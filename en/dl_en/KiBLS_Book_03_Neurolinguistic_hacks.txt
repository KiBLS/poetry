A seething volcano

Am I happy with my life?
Or is there a tremor deep inside of me?

To destroy everything old in me,
and summon a change?

It is a comprehensive transformation.
Lift me from below to a throne?

From deep down all the way up.
The change now take its course.

Like Phoenix out of the ashes.
Like ripening wine in a bottle.

It has been germinating in me for a long time,
to shine really bright in the end.

The real power, it grows up.
It closes every human in its spell.

And if the old has once passed.
The good will become an endless power.

Chase the Abyss

There are so many paths.
But so few - even.

There are so many ways.
But so few ways out.

There are so many journeys,
But so few arrivals.

There is so much of everything.
But there are just a few of "so much".

Break the circle

I say as usual: regretfully!
I've made another lap.

One lap after the next,
I just walk in circles.

It's not nice in this circle,
the body gasps and gets pretty hot.

No human recognizes the circle,
no one calls the agony by name.

The agony of survive, again and again.
every lap raze me down once more.

Clenched power burns inside of me,
which still accomplish many laps.

But more and more here in circles,
I'm getting old and yet not wise.

Until I break the circle of life,
Only then you recognize; nothing was ever in vain!

Only Mother Nature

One should work every hour,
do not notice how the roses smell.

After all, time is expensive money,
that's why the whole world is spinning today.

But when you stop your time just a moment.
Every flower attracts you in its spell.

The minutes and the hours do not matter.
Anytime you can choose them!

Watch the wonderful nature.
Blooms for you the pure life.

Give mother nature just a kiss,
and a stressful life becomes a pleasure!

Clownish theater

Is everything just a holographic bogus?
Will become just a dream in the end?

The biggest clown keeps screaming loudly;
"give me quickly the next bride!"

We play pure puppet theater,
your role - she is exactly "here"!

Whether we dream or hallucinate,
Sweat, shiver or freeze.

It's just an abstract stage play
Experience bad luck or play with bliss!

From inside to outside

I am my own idol,
I feel so good inside!

I am full of contentment and happiness.
Experience it as an endless long piece.

Nobody needs to offer me something,
because I am satisfied inside.

I want to become like I already am!
Live this one moment in the middle of it.

The light falls into the darkness.
It ends the reign of the linear time.

When the last veil finally falls,
will it change the whole world!

Limited development?

The unrest rages deep inside of me,
the change stands in front of the door.

The direction - still obscure,
the beginning - was the other day.

Unnoticed, everything started.
But will it ends sometime?

The signs can still dazzle.
The situation will soon change.

The first time you realized the meaning,
like a grain in a heap of sand.

Infinite gets redefined,
Time centered in the middle.

The key fits in the lock,
like the rider on its steed.

Perfection in purity.
After the fission, unity grows.

---------------------------------------------------------

Off into the matrix

Here and now and without atonement,
we enter the big stage.

The aura is shining very bright.
This is the onliest way to rhyme honestly.

The chakras are harmonized,
only in this way the body works.

The energy field is balanced,
Time has just flew by so fast.

Harmony - truly difficult to master,
but finally found, she knows how to inspire you.

She rises like a phoenix,
with the poetry of a king.

Gossip factory

It is rumored so much.
Because the sun is darkened.

It is reported a lot.
Clouds are heavily condensed.

There is a lot of whispering.
Muttered over fine dust.

It is told a lot.
What torments people to be nasty.

It is written a lot,
If bad, it will be likely exaggerated.

Finding the truth is not easy.
Because freedom is achieved by it.

Unity in everyday life

I do the same every day.
Feel myself thereby like a corpse.
Every day the same routine,
serving the Mammon - my God?

A whole life full of days,
the question arises for me;
What do the days have in mind?
The answer - is deep inside of me.

But I can not find it,
I have to toil myself every day.
Full with distractions and colorful mica,
I sit in my room in the evening.

The way out - is right under my nose.
In the development - only one phase.
In the infinite aspect of being.
Everything will become one.

World theater

Whether noble banker or dubious dealer,
they are all the best - actors.

Everyone plays his own role perfectly,
Everyone is involved - into the biggest project.

Holography is truly fantastic;
in the right hand it acts - plastically.

Because behind the curtain everything is dark,
Such a deep black - with bright sparkle.

All entertainment is just for you!
All opposites - meet each other!

Me and you

I do not wear the same shirt.
And yet you are not foreign to me.

I do not wear the same pants.
And yet I like your pose.

I do not wear the same dress.
And yet I share your suffering.

I do not wear the same shoes.
And yet I am (as you)!

Oh, the love

Oh, you humans come and see!
You have twisted the whole world.

Oh, you humans come and marvel!
The whole world is in a bad mood.

Oh, you humans come and feel!
The whole world, emotionally cooled.

Oh, you humans just feel - it's time!
The whole world is crying for a change.

You just need to start sincerely loving!
Because love can not be defeated by any human!

The Grim Reaper

The Grim Reaper is facing me.
I feel; he wants to come over to me.

Has my time come yet?
Everything seems so blurry!

My strength and energy; they are dwindling.
I am still looking for something, I have to find it!

Minutes, hours, days; completely the same.
The time she runs by so fast.

The hope; it disappears.
In the end, does Grim Reaper win?

After a long time my fears disappear.
The journey begins, it is not the last, but the longest!

Dual contradictions

Should I have a rest?
Or should I do something useful?
Leave everything as it is?
I can't put anything into words.

Deep within me there is - oppression...
Thereby so far away - happiness.
Good and bad thoughts,
let me waver within.

Look; life is like a game!
Everything together leads to the goal.
Whether good or bad,
whether it's wrong or right.

No moment was ever in vain,
it leads to the goal no matter where you come from.
All good and bad together,
ignites your own heart.

Something bad done,
that was well thought out in the beginning?
Something good done with your heart,
to experience bad things afterwards?

Many ways lead to " that point ",
there's a reason for everything!
The best thing to do is rejoice,
and never fear unknown paths.

German change

All true poets and all thinkers,
They turn to a faithful leader!

This apathetic, german country,
needs again a powerful hand!

The constitutional state, it has served its time!
All duties were long splinted.

Democracy was a long term issue!
It only benefited the brazen so extremely!

The new way of ruling in this country!
Is now breaking the old shame again!

The German country was oppressed for a long time,
We were all very enchanted by these changes!

But the real change has been a long procedure!
What comes now is a real reparation!

Germany awakes

I'm from ..., I was born here.
I realized that everything is conspired.

In every little corner - and in every town,
the bigger ones checkmate the smaller ones.

Suppress and destroy the potential,
like no one would ever judge it.

But the land of poets and thinkers is awakening!
If we do nothing, it would be ridiculous!

Now we take the control that we deserve!
We touched the lowest ground long enough!

All poets, thinkers and philosophers,
now rhyme for peace precious verses.

A triumph among the people means eternal peace!
We have already decided to do so for a long time!

The last time

Will my writings one day be burned?
Well banished from the mindset?

The seed - it has long been spread.
No matter how much you hurry!

From the seedling grows a tree.
Nobody can control its growth!

Further and further towards the sun,
Dreams are becoming a blessing.

Is fantasy a part of reality?
Or is reality a part of fantasy?

One will understand the unity soon!
The truth will be seen very soon!

The Sun

Every evening she goes down briefly.
Every morning she makes you smile.

Every day she shines down on us.
Every night her light is very scarce.

Every time I see her again,
I feel her warm closeness again.

She goes on another round,
She'll be bright again in the morning.

The sun often appears too bright to many people,
but only thanks to her it will be light again!

The Turn of Time

It's an old guild,
without any sanity.

Born to reign?
Chosen by God himself?

There will appear one power.
It will unite everything.

Everyone can see it coming!
This change will happen!

Old things pass away and new things blossom!
Before it inflames it glows all around.

Awakening from a deep sleep

The whole life is like a theater play!
Everyone plays his part, full of joy!

Now it is performed with all its vigour.
Peace that lasts forever is achieved by it!

The whole German country; deeply in twilight sleep,
but there are only a few rhymes needed!

These words are like tinder, they blaze fast!
Even the golden sun will soon shine brightly again!

The sky - it will soon be dark blue again!
Because the Germans - they are truly clever!

A German only will bring the great turning point!
And devour all evil with his light!

Foreign Words

Many lives have been yours.
You do not become wise on your own.

Truly you have passed the test,
Now find out all the rest!

It will be a very long journey!
The wisdom will be yours forever!

You can make yourself immortal now!
You only have to do something once more!

Pay attention to the cycle of the nature!
And enjoy your wisdom pure!

Thoughts re-formation

Does the "sound" have any weight?
Can I feel basses on my face?

Is the "vibration" a mass?
Pressure points of various classes?

What weights green and what the light?
There is a new science in sight.

Weight, mass, meters and also degrees,
distract from the "universal path".

The mind is restructured,
Thoughts combined with each other.

The truth will be recognized!
The lie will then be banished!

Ruling Servantship

Oh my noble Lord, excuse me!
But are my thoughts still free?

Is the control becoming scarce?
If I have my very own opinion?

May I look directly into your eyes?
Or will you oppress me further?

Deep inside me rages a true hurricane!
The one who wants to end this madness forever!

But now I place myself above you,
it won't help the whole situation.

It can't be in the long run!
Eternally this master with his little minion!

So let us wake up together!
To laugh together about old times!

Because who ever wants to rule only,
he also has to constantly peal somebody!

Every year presents its seasons,
let yourself be guided by them now!

Understanding what is written here can only;
Who gives me a faithful oath!

Are you now afraid of the beast?
Remember; there are four seasons!

Please dispel your unnecessary sorrows!
Then I will give you another morning!

The sun has been watching for you a long time!
She gives you a kiss on your cheek!

Verses of life

I dared so much in my life,
and thereby spoils my chances.

The whole life is only a false illusion,
I thought it would be more but it shouldn't be.

Will I play along in this depressing drama?
No matter what I did I never found - the true happiness.

But the courage it is growing from within!
Together with Him, you will achieve very high heights!

What the whole life is supposed to be you ask yourself now?
If you were almighty; what would you do?

Just use this one big opportunity!
Now finally get ready for your life!

People of today

Many people are naive today,
because the time; it's relative.

Many people are confused today,
because the world doesn't belong to them.

Many people are on the floor today,
because their life has too many cycles.

Many people are at their end today,
because their way is full of foreignness.

But even today there are people,
which rejoices their whole life!

Because who will see the light once,
will be fully refreshed in all being.

New Speak Theater

Rhyming in Newspeak - not easy at all.
Language censored - words recalibrated.

I slowly get a big hangover.
From this stupid new-speak theater.

Never write something incorrect.
Do not stick around old views.

Everything is banned and censored,
until the last stubborn head parries.

Because with less beautiful words,
it's easier to promote stupidity.

The great ideas - they will all go.
The next generation will see it approaching!

Newspeak will cut off all thoughts.
Philosophers must avoid so many words.

Humanity has a hard time grasping it!
So many people will speak in two classes.

Just accept it!

I know what you're spending money on!
What you hate and what you love.

I know where you spend your free time!
What songs you are singing in the shower.

I know who you are talking to!
What kind of people you worship.

I know exactly what you like!
Whatever you complain about friends.

Protecting data? No hurry!
I know what you have searched for online!

Cleaning of the world

Everything's about the money!
After that the half world will jump!

It is the one power that moves everyone!
No matter on which side it strikes out!

Whether on the dark or light side,
opponents will seek the distance in front of the Force!

Opposites burn victims like in a storm,
They' re gonna get kicked like a worm.

But the change is already standing at the gate!
Listen only to your inner "tender words"!

The journey here has not been in vain!
Soon a big man will take the little broom!

He sweeps away all the trash at once!
It becomes then clean where before was only dirt!

Judicial Grace

A lot of applications and also fines,
Wait for you in the German harbour.

There are complicated writings everywhere,
Totalitarian states drift on the precipice.

Sometimes one is acquitted too,
but this is not not always a custom!

You are wondering what it depends on now?
Judicial grace - truly disgusting!

Do you not face up to your accusation?
then you' re putting your life on the scale.

But truly weighing is not what is done here!
Negotiations take place on the market and in court!

Conspiracy

Am I a conspiracy theoretician,
or in the end a truth preacher?

Is the whole world that sick?
Are doctors putting money in a safe?

Is the whole world blinded?
Is every day property seized?

Is the world completely disinformed?
Is the truth now oriented around lies?

Truth or lie, many do can' t see it,
the good always shines in the same light!

Radiated world

Radiation acts like a hard damper!
Let it go and turn into a fighter!

The world, it is now changing radically!
The world, she now overthrows the old system!

For many centuries suppressed,
The victory scarcely happened to anyone!

But now a new time is dawning!
Are you ready for this change?

Labour of the modern age

The greatest words of my life.
Do you feel it? A quake?

The last move in this chess,
the mass is moving and brightly awake.

The change is seeing the light,
the world only has it in sight.

from string became solid rope.
It was a really long birth.

What happens from now on,
all humanity sees.
