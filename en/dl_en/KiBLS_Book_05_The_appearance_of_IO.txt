The way to the treasure

I want to speak only great words!
Start from the ground like the birds.

I want to speak only wise words!
The lost wisdom found in many hearts.

I want to speak only inspiring words!
Sharpening my mind like a holy sword.

I want to speak only divine words!
Filled with love that comes from the heart.

But no matter what I ever speak.
And even if my words sounds weak.

No matter what will be my share.
And how I spread them anywhere,

I'll always look up to them.
To be my wisest guide out there.

Lovely development

What if I give you my heart?
And all the stars from the sky.

What if I give you my soul?
And all the treasures from the sea.

What if I give you, my whole self?
To take the good and bad of me till the end.

Would you accept these gifts?
To share it with me as additional shifts?

Would you be there when I'll most need?
To make for me things true and complete?

When you're not with me I miss a part,
Because in my life you're the greatest art!

But no matter where you are,
My love is never far!

Limitless distance

You seem so far
But you are so close.
You're next to me
You're in my prose.

When i close my eyes,
I can feel you!
When i stay quiet,
I can hear you!

In every star
In every thought,
In every dream
You come along.

No distance can divide us!
No force can subdue us!
No matter what I do,
I constantly think of you.

Whatever you may say
Whatever you may do,
You are with me forever
And I am bound to you.


In this world exist no distance
Which can end our wonderful dance.
Our terpsichorean art has begun
Turning everything soon into just One.

Listen to the bells

Can you hear them ringing?
Can you hear them singing?

High up in the mountains.
And deep inside the oceans.

Sound like operas created out of wonders.
Striking unforgettable like the thunder.

Announcing a new time.
And stanzas full with rhyme.

Listen carefully what they "speak".
You can find what you may seek.

While they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.
All the stars begin to twinkle.

The journey begins

Today I will follow my fate.
Today I will open the gate.

Equipped with everything necessary.
Nothing more here that could be scary.

I have to start my walk alone.
It leads me out of my comfort zone.

I will explore wonderful worlds,
Inspiring me to write beautiful words.

I'll bring out the best in me.
A strong foundation of how it shall be.

Day after day I'll walk toward light,
With all the heavens by my side.

And when I reach my goal,
All the parts will be a whole.

The own realization

Now my thoughts are free.
They are flying like a bee.

Thoughts of wisdom and of truth.
Thoughts of elderly and the youth.

Inside of me everything is united.
Inside of me I was never divided.

In hard times I didn't give up.
Divine light has raised me up.

Whatever I dream, I will create.
On thoughts of wisdom I relate.

So many thoughts are passing by.
Many make me feel like i could fly.

Just a last step and I stride trough the door.
To experience what I have always felt before.
