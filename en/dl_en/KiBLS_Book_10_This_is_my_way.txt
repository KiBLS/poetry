The last passing hour

I am not talking about any mystery!
What I am doing here is writing history!

In me awakened an irrepressible power.
Right now it is ringing my biggest hour.

The fog lifts and clarity comes in.
It was long been written that I'll win.

Hypnotically attractive and yet despised.
Ephemeral and yet forever immortalized.

Just one last awakening, one last strike.
And everything will work the way I like.

The sacred path

My body is built with sacred geometry.
My path is as unique as my poetry.

I just can go on, there's no more stop.
In my quest, I push everything to the top.

A wandering to the ancient highlands.
On my way I will leave diamonds.

Immortal thoughts for future generations.
A new era without oppressive nations.

Everything will change and develope.
To finally create a totally new scope.

It's not for sale!

I am enlightened, but what now?
In this society unprofitable somehow!

Nothing changed, everything stayed the same.
Everybody just keeps playing their game.

And yet it have changed every goal.
And mainly my own view of the whole.

I realized that this isn't the end.
I only dared the first ascent!

The way to the top is finally free.
That's why many more will follow me.

A new mindset in process of exchanging.
And thus the whole world is changing.

Change of rooms

It was my own decision!
To overcome this division.

Leaving the old load behind.
To strengthen the own mind.

To unite the separated.
To awake the unlocated.

To make blind people see.
Providing them a matching key.

Just capabilities to enter a new room.
Where miracles starts again to bloom.

Enlightened

A new day follows the long night.
Darkness frees the room for new light.

Constantly change is part of the whole.
Love is the main ingredient of any soul.

It is the inner peace that I have found.
Now I can determine rules for the next round.

Ancient wisdom I let out of the bag.
Thereby "Victory" is written on my flag.

Beyond any imagination grows my winning!
Because I'm describing this new beginning.

Your restitution

My body belongs exclusively to me.
Now I will let my thoughts free!

You can oppress me as much as you want!
Repeatedly I will get up and run to the front.

I am going to break the old chain.
Starting a new era with no reign.

You'll be witness with your own eyes.
How the venerable Phoenix will now rise.

One way of many

My mind was strongly sedated.
And I have never really meditated.

Always done what I thought was right.
And yet I've never noticed my own light.

So many problems and so few solutions.
They died painfully; all my illusions.

And at the end, just before the turnaround.
It was my own insanity which I have found.

My whole self was suddenly disintegrated.
There was nothing left that could be rated.

And how the butterfly slips out of its cocoon,
I finally received the greatest boon.

Recognize freedom

Like a regal lion I wanted to roar.
While I was breaking through every door.

I wanted to get faster with every meter.
And I was sprinting like a cheetah.

A big steam roller I used to clear the road.
Like a terminator I was in a destroying mode.

My quest turned me into a real berserker.
But honestly I became just a simple worker.

In this way the time until now has passed.
But another change will happen very fast.

All burdens and worries are suddenly gone.
After I realized that I've already won.

A new teaching area

I'll find words that change the world!
My thoughts are already unfurled.

Nothing from the outside will stop me.
Because I can imagine how it could be.

With a vision of love deep in the heart.
I will now realize the highest art.

The alchemy has long been known.
But now the alphilosophy will be shown.

Your own intentions make it practicable.
The effects are just unimaginable.

The seeds have already been planted.
A first impression was just granted.

An unified dream

My inner light is on fire.
It easily unmasks every liar.

The Inner voice now takes the lead.
And thus it will revise every creed.

The inner world begins to shine.
I can recognize my inner shrine.

Pure creativity circulates in my mind.
The outside world is simply redefined.

All thought frames will be removed.
And thereby every change is approved.

All the frequencies just synchronize.
That in the end an unified dream can arise.

Just one Waypoint

What is the purpose of this trip, you wonder?
Your whole ego will finally go under!

But that's not all!
The curtain will also fall!

You will see and recognize "it"!
Each role will suddenly quit.

But that only happens when you're alone!
It hits your mind like a stone!

You'll never forget this moment!
First a real shock, then a true bestowment.

Everything will make sense.
You realize a totally new tense.

Just keep walking your own way!
And listen what your inner leader say!

That's my new path!

I have thoughts that are rare.
I write about wisdom to bare.

No matter what others ever said.
I just keep going ahead.

I know truth from experience.
And that makes a difference!

All mental blocks have been dissolved.
And something new evolved.

Its more beautiful than any butterfly.
Cause all answers appeared for every why.

It's just the dawn of a new age.
The wisdom erupts now from its cage.

Sacred Linguistic

Even if I still sometimes drop.
But now I run to the top!

Even if sometimes I write strange.
But now I write for change!

Even if some verses makes no sense.
They are able to break every defense!

The whole mind just renews.
And all dreams simply fuse.

Mankind awakens through sunshine,
and water transforms again into wine.

---------------------------------------------------------

Celestial Barriers

The inner creativity just flows!
On this way I write historical rows.

I still see an empty screen.
The display is still clean.

Words and ideas bubble out of me.
I can't help but let them go free.

Verses manifest word by word.
They simply make themselves heard.

They come from the mind to the virtual paper!
And they fly far above every skyscraper.

The sacred plan

My whole being serves only one aim.
And the great whole pursues the same.

I just try to spread enlightenment.
This is a humanities legal entitlement.

A holistic illusion is revealed.
A holy covenant is resealed.

This epiphany moment ends every program,
to finally terminates every previous scam.

Holy enlightenment through everyone's madness.
followed by the recognition of one's own badness.

And what some will lead to their end,
will be for others just a new ascent.

One moment in my life

Reading my own poems was like the red pill.
To reach enlightenment without my own will.

It just happened on its own.
When I was in my room alone.

It was like a heavy bang on the head.
The whole stage play was suddenly dead.

Every burden fell right off me.
And immediately I felt free.

Everyone plays his role sacrificially.
Hooray for the holy Allphilosophy.

The description doesn't fit in any book.
It's perfection down to the smallest nook!

Philanthropic reformation

I let my light shine, it will never end!
Like a firm lighthouse I will never bend!

A bright beam illuminates everything dark.
It radiates like an igniting spark.

An extensive light is now triggered.
Each observer will be re-configured.

Selflessness annihilate every frustration.
Healing begins without any hesitation.

Mankind is acting united with a common goal.
Philanthropic thoughts working for the whole.

By uncovering the final deception,
we will all reach true perfection.

Forced freedom

A new day is dawning.
The master is drawing.

Finally found the source.
Discovered the true force.

All thoughts begin to groove.
This makes the pen move.

The wisdom appears.
Just leaving all fears.

Mankind is ready to rise.
It's a spectacle for all eyes.

Program correction

Actually, I'm already crowned.
Now my mind is racing around.

Does that make me a winner?
Or am I just a holy sinner?

Words straight from the heart.
Showing a long forgotten art.

Suppressed truths are just rising.
They don't need any kind of advertising.

They'll correct simply your basic program.
Because the old one is steeped in a scam.

I've resigned!

I can no longer pretend for 8 hours a day.
It is time that I walk my own way!

I have absolutely no idea where I'm going.
But deep inside I have a reassuring knowing.

My thoughts were tearing me apart inside.
More than 8 hours a day my inner life died.

Now I wanna leave in peace and let myself fall.
I surrender to the unknown to finally stand tall.

I will now grow and be wise.
I will be like a phoenix that rise.

So let my new journey now start!
From now I'll follow only my heart!
