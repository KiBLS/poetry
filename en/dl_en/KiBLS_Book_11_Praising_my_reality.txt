You are special!

With you I love to stay.
You make me smile every day.

You're the dearest of all.
You hold me when I fall.

You're the brightest light in the town.
You speak well with me when I'm down.

You support me in difficult times.
You stay forever in my rhymes.

I am the paper and you are the pen.
And every morning we will write again.

Raise the curtain!

Oh, you great stage work in front of my eyes.
You show me the truth right next to lies.

I can see the good seed directly in the evil.
I recognize your visions in times of upheaval.

You are doing real miracles all over the land.
Everything of yours is so perfectly planned.

I am born straight from you, and here I go.
You created me from the head to the toe.

Now I leave the winter and welcome the spring.
Together we will transform everything.

Reality lover

No matter where you live!
This life has so much to give!

Simply banish the gray!
And start enjoying this day!

After a storm the rainbow is drawn.
Such perfection will just go on.

Simply let your heart bloom!
Recognize your changing playroom!

There's so much to discover!
Just enjoy reality like a lover.

Until the old age

You're everything I dream of.
You're indeed my true love!

There will be just me and you forever.
We both achieve just everything together!

No power in the world can stop us!
We have no differences to discuss.

You keep going with me at walking pace.
We'll soon discover a wonderful place.

And in many decades we both will remember.
That we were together every year from January to December.

With you I could never be in strife.
Because you're the greatest joy in my life.

The opening tune

I surrender all my heart,
to this beautiful art.

I can feel the beat of nature,
while i watch its portraiture.

The flowers starts to dance in the breeze
This beauty compels me on my knees.

Everything vibrates and lights up.
Nature now finally stands up!

I can recognize all the power.
For nature is now ringing in its hour.

Now more than ever!

Even if no one ever reads my book,
I'll write it only for myself!

Even if no one ever follows my path,
I'll walk it only for myself!

Even if no one ever sees what I'm doing,
I'll do it only for myself!

Even if no one ever watch how I reach the goal,
I'll reach it only for myself!

The own perception

What you can see or read.
Is exactly what you need!

What you can smell or taste.
Is exactly what needs to be faced!

What you can perceive and feel.
Is exactly what you need to heal!

Just everything around of you.
Has always been here and is not new.

Thought filter creates your perception.
Because everything is pure deception!

Hello and welcome!

Welcome to a marvelous reality!
A single moment full of similarity.

Just start watching carefully!
And all realities unite cheerfully.

Enjoy your dream right now.
Please, let me show you how!

But don't focus on any bad!
Because this could make you sad!

Create everything first in your mind!
And it will be happiness that you'll find.

Know that all will happen anyhow!
And start to live your dreams right now!
