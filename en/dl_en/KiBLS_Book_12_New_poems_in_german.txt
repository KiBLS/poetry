The melody of freedom

We are the voices that no longer fall silent.
We are the ones who hum the song of freedom.

It works like a catchy tune in your head.
Our song grabs the evil by its head.

Everyone's freedom is the supreme good!
It takes courage to announce this loudly.

Our melody echoes also in the last corners.
To wake up even the last sleepers.

The change is already in full swing!
But development sometimes takes a long time!

Our serenade gets louder and louder.
Our melody sounds more and more familiar.

Easy choice

Distract yourself with unimportant things?
Or start to think for yourself?

Deal with unnecessary things?
Or start to strengthen yourself?

Keep turning in endless circles?
Or start to see for yourself?

Sue each other in processes?
Or dare a new beginning?

You always have the free choice!
That makes the whole life so awesome!

Prophetic merits

The prophet in his own country.
Appears outwardly full of shame.

The message reaches its recipient.
The transmission simply takes a little longer.

Words of a very special kind!
They open your inner gate.

The effect is highly efficient.
And at the same time recursive!

The intention, it is always the same!
This change, it is truly extensive!

The moment is being reshaped!
Thoughts completely new normed!

It starts

Artificially created envy.
Produces a special kind of suffering.

Energetically charged explosions!
Interwoven with confused illusions!

This time all the fuses are burning!
This change will come from below!

Mankind has conjured it!
The old system is already for a long time lost!

Everyone cries out for change!
It appears after the last trade!

War and Peace

There's a host of legions lining up!
The story now takes its course.

The great spectacle, it begins.
The outcome is already long' determined!

We are now in transition!
Soon nothing is of importance anymore!

Your whole being will be restructured!
While everything seems to collapse all around.

You have found the true core!
Now begin to explore it in detail!

Your freedom!

Now write your own words!
Only they open the forgotten gate!

Read them carefully and thoroughly!
Remember - at best hourly!

You will then transform everything!
It will happen then just like that!

Nobody can stop this process!
In the end you will simply top everything!

When many realities merge,
it has worldwide consequences!

Described art

Creativity is discovered and lived!
Deep inside me, it truly quakes everywhere!

Words that simply sprout,
and colours that flow together!

Everything harmonizes and plays together.
The creativity, it is igniting!

Potential to change the whole world!
Art spreads in all countries!

It comes from the inside to the outside.
From deep indoors to far outdoors.

The change sees the light!
The new world moves in sight!

Connectedness

I'm listening to your loud scream!
And you think it doesn't bother me.

It shakes me deep in my marrow.
But for you I remain strong!

Even if you seek the distance!
I stand nevertheless at your side!

If you need me, I am always there!
Every single day, the entire year!

No matter if it storms, rains or snows.
My support is always at your disposal!

Rays of perdition

Something hurts me a lot inside:
It's the effects of 5G.

The tolerability was determined?
The SAR value is labeled "scientific"?

It imitates a human subject?
A water balloon as test object?

The microwave on the head for hours.
One voluntarily and gladly pushes the button.

The blood circulation is inhibited and totally clotted.
The whole brain becomes stupid in the long run!

But even apart from the health mania!
Or from Bluetooth, infrared and wireless Lan!

Every single beam is reflected!
Thus every material is simply declared.

An area-wide, documented irradiation.
A locating of all rooms justifies the payment.

A dual system

I create the wrong and the real.
I create the left and the right.

I connect and I disconnect.
I am good and I am bad.

I bury and I dig up treasures.
I unite all opposites within me.

I am here and I am there.
I come and I go away.

An illusion creates friend and foe.
An illusion that divides and unites.

Overcoming the contradiction

These words will change your life!
These words will lift you up!

The sacred, it'll break through all pores.
The sacred, it's being born again.

Everywhere you look, you can see it!
Everywhere contradictions are burning!

Come over here and tear me down!
I'll still sing songs of freedom!

Contradict me and I'll clear up!
Suppress me and I'll stand up!

I don't care if others like it!
I'll change now the whole world!

Ageless truth

Everything "is" at the same time.
All happiness and all suffering.

Every stick and stone,
can be in another place.

Where the focus is directed,
things are going to be re-exposed.

The shadow game starts.
It takes the unity out of "the whole".

In the valley of boredom

The clock, it turns.
But time, it does not pass.

No minutes, no hours.
Showing the end of time.

Everything is just an illusion.
The visual appearance is very subtle.

The question that now arises;
does anything in this world actually happen?

Or does everything in this world happen all at once?
The course of time - the true tribulation?

The time - it resides deep inside of you.
where all truths have been shimmering forever.

The faith in love

Faith ends where understanding begins.
Understanding ends where insight begins.

Insight ends where acceptance begins.
Acceptance ends where knowledge begins.

Knowledge ends where experience begins.
Experience ends where wisdom begins.

Wisdom ends where love begins.

The new life

Today's the day!
It is finally happening!

The seedling is breaking out of the ground.
The seeds reach out to the sunlight.

The real adventure now begins,
A new child is born now.

A totally unknown variety.
The change is knocking at the door.

The light is now being focused!
A new vision is now integrated!

Use the time!

The history can teach you,
and the future should be honoured.

But precious is only this moment,
for it is never separate.

The "now" influences the times.
Let this "now" be your guide!

The timeline will be broken,
this has been promised for a long time.

Previous boundaries are blurring,
by inner tones that are in tune.

Just let this change happen.
Thereby old suffering will pass away!

A change full of light

He who seeks his end shall shape it.
And he who seeks redemption shall receive it.

Where are the true sages of this world?
Do they all sell themselves here for money?

It was once in times past,
where enlightened beings guided the people.

Today a virtual god is doing this,
in a shell of electronic waste.

He blinds every true seeker,
and sells alms for usury.

But in such truly dark times,
the light will once again take the path.

For only in the deepest darkness,
can the light be recognized with certainty.

It will shine brighter than ever before!
The power of the heart will soon open the gate.
