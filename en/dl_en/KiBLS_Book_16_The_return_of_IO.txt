Welcome to the change

Yes! Let's walk again together!
No matter what kind of weather!

Scorching sun or fiery wind.
We are back again to win.

The old burdens won't hold us back!
No matter how hard they'll attack!

With new dreams on the horizon.
And the sun which keeps up rising.

We are sailing through the waves.
Leaving behind Platon's cave.

Our curiosity outweighs any fear.
Welcome to the change, right now and here!

The Truth

Waking up means to open the eyes!
Waking up means to end the lies!

Waking up and staying strong!
And true freedom will come along.

Lies, deceits and all that stuff.
As time goes by, it made me tough.

Speak the truth and speak it loud.
In the end that's all about.

Misguided society

Many people trust no one other.
Cause they know about Big Brother.

Many people are inner divided!
Cause real help was never provided!

Many people are torn apart inside.
Cause they never had a trustful guide.

In this world where right is wrong,
Many failed to keep up strong.

In this world where wrong is right,
Many walked into the darkest night.

And for many light is still far,
far away like a bright star.

Timeless aspects

Every minute and every hour!
I can feel inside of me this power!

Every day and every week!
Each moment is just unique!

Every year and every decade!
All that time, I've successfully played!

Every now and then I think.
How times flies just in a blink.

Getting stronger, getting wiser,
To become your own advisor.

Travelling as one with the inner guide.
To finally enjoy the greatest ride.
