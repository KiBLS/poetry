Intellectual union

We were waiting to be heard.
And now masters raise the word!

The freedom to change a system.
True power is growing by wisdom.

Many lies and suffering we were facing.
But our power is truly all-embracing.

What we were taught did not please our soul!
Unified power operates now beyond all control.

Mental synchronizations are becoming strong.
Come and join us! Let's sing the freedom song!

Together at the front line

We all share a common goal!
We all develope the whole!

We fight for an ancient truth!
There is nothing here to lose!

People want to worship a horned cow!
So let us publish all the wisdom now!

We are releasing the shackles of doubt,
To liberate reason and spread it about.

The critical mass will be soon aware.
From this point on we will play really fair.

In this we all have concepts to reveal.
To rise up together and collectively heal.

Chapter of awakening

Philosophers, raise your voice.
Let us ascend, we have no choice!

Now get the words out of your heart.
Let's show mankind this ancient art!

Where wisdom reigns everything flowers.
They come from deep within - eternally powers.

Answer the call and write to exist.
Philosophers', you must fight to persist!

The battle begins alone inside of you.
And after your success, we create everything anew.

Reach for the stars

No matter where I ever go.
I am like water in a flow.

I can see the beauty everywhere.
Simply by becoming more aware.

This world wants to be explored!
This call has long been ignored.

The earth beneath my feet is living.
In front of me is the nature to dive in.

The Sky is above me and is so amazing.
Countless stars are what I'm chasing.

Stars so close, I never noticed it before.
Now I'm ready to experience so much more!

Radical change

The shadow play before your eyes.
A final exposure of all lies.

Everyone recognizes that he is locked.
Everyone who looks around is shocked.

So many lights illuminate now the darkness.
This is why all shadows appear in full sharpness.

All responses given were never true!
The onliest honest answer lies within you!

Come together!

We are the developement makers.
We are the final issue breakers.

We seek no outside power.
We came for the final hour.

We all have made the decision.
To fulfill together this mission.

Together we stand for love and peace.
Together we will create change with ease.

Remember!

We are part of the oldest collective.
We all follow an ancient directive.

We have a single voice to speak.
And yet each one of us is unique!

We know the non-existent cause.
So we preserve these ancient laws.

We all can listen to the playing drum.
Individual minds are all linked as one.

And now all things they seem to scatter.
As all we see apears to shatter.

So still the ancient voice within.
Connect as once we did again.

We are a part of the oldest collective.
We remember our roots and change the perspective.

Modern Fairy Tales

There is so much panic and most have no clue.
20,000 in Germany die each year of flu.

The virus test is highly hypersensitive.
This makes all its results relative.

No one is putting this test to the test.
We'll be forced to take it at their behest.

Simultaneously, economy "accidentally" crashed.
And every critic is now extremely bashed.

A system built on the bust and the boom.
Was always going to destine us to doom.

Now we have this "virus" that we can blame.
For our lives never being the same again.

Major offences in motion by the unseen hand.
This is all conditioning for their future plan.

Censorship reigns in this era of madness.
And police "do their duty" with new-found gladness.

Messages repeat verging on the subliminal.
And everyone risks becoming a criminal.

Trust is eroded watch out for your neighbour!
We were warned about this, Orwell gave it the flavour.

The surveillance eats its way deep into your inner self.
Big brother isn't just sitting on a bookshelf.

But all that confusing, outside fuss.
Is just the result from all of us!

And the deepest point where everybody desperate,
is the moment that becomes simply unforgettable great!

In desperate moments with so much in doubt.
We will rise together to figure the last details out.

What comes in the future is ours to decide.
And if we choose freedom, we'll stand side by side.

The next wave

Worldwide influence from north to east.
Are you ready for the mark of the beast?

All wisdom and truth will not lay to rest.
As they push to control us for financial interests.

Every autumn will bring a new wave of flu.
So make yourself ready for Corona part 2!

Turn off the TV, walk out of your door!
Use your mind and your body, just go explore!

Hug your family and friends, show that you care.
If someone needs help be willing to share.

Go to a mountain & climb to the peak!
Let the world know that it's Freedom you seek!

I look fearlessly into the eyes of evil.
And recognize the times of holy upheaval.

The old, dark era is finally ending!
And the new era just starts to blend in!
