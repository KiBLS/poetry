The way of the heart

I don't always write the right things!
But I always listen what my heart sings!

I don't always walk the right ways.
But I always listen what my heart says!

My inner voice is always around.
It supports me when I am downed.

It steers me back when danger is near.
And teaches me to love without any fear.

I trust in its truth and power,
it blossoms within me like a flower.

And when I doubt if some motives are pure,
I listen to my heart then I can be sure.

Inevitably

I am speaking to every nation!
I am here for your inspiration!

I will show you what is wrong!
I will show you where you belong!

We finally see what we can achieve,
when in each other we truly believe.

Our consciousness is searching a new height.
So we’ll stand together side by side.

Our thoughts are acting as one.
Because of this, we've already won!

Antonym Reflectionality

How will everything change and when?
This day is now almost over again.

I feel ready for the great transmit!
When will I be able to feel just some of it?

Please tell me when comes the time?
When will I be full sublime?

When the evil will burn?
When will come this great turn?

But wait! I can now feel it begin.
The changes are coming from deep within.

And now, at last, I’m starting to see.
That this great change begins with you and me.

---------------------------------------------------------

Ascend in the moment

You don't notice your own decay,
when stress makes your hair turn grey.

Permanently only the time in view.
Always looking for something new.

Distracted with the daily grind.
Forgetting how to nourish the mind.

Rushing through life like it is a race.
Not noticing life’s beauty and grace.

Don’t live in the future, it’s uncertain.
Be present before it’s the final curtain.

Games in the shadows

You are developing within the money economy.
You know we play here a game called monopoly.

You might still stand while everything goes down.
But you know that we all lose our crown.

Cogs in a wheel in perpetual motion,
Steer towards a financial explosion.

Measuring our worth in digital paper.
Knowing that we'll all be cast aside later.

But we know true worth lies outside of this ruse,
If we know the game is rigged no one will lose!

Price of freedom

Your freedom is not yet lost!
But it is at stake, at great cost.

Stand up now make yourself heard!
Just rise up like a holy Phoenix bird!

The words act as fire accelerants.
My inflamed heart starts to dance.

We all have a mission to follow.
Pursue it like there's no tomorrow.

Each will make their contribution.
As we collaborate to create the solution.

The stakes are high and we cannot fail.
Humanity's freedom will prevail.

Blocked by a chain

A chain never sets you free!
It forces you to your knee!

Your freedom is "blocked" by a chain!
These blocking chains already reign.

The gag's getting for real tighter,
but the darkness is also getting brighter!

The light will break all these chains!
To finally dissolve never ending pains.

The only way to finally end this fight,
is to allow yourself to bathe in the light.

To realise and awaken your true potential.
To become your own master, it's essential!

Tuning of the Minds

We are united in our mind,
Our thoughts are perfectly aligned.

We act in concert as one!
We are only here to have fun.

We are never lost or separated!
We resonate with what's created.

Our energy is never ending.
Through the messages we are sending.

Move down the curtain

Now it follows blow by blow.
We'll deliver a great show!

The feeling is incredibly pleasurable!
And the quality is no longer measurable!

We will never, ever bow!
We will climb up from below!

Our true selves are at last discovered.
Our destinies will be finally uncovered.

And our connection to all that has been.
Will show us the way that was before unseen.

The global exposure

You think our problem is just local?
The truth is it is already global!

You think the poverty is just in your land?
It's organised worldwide by a hidden hand.

Everywhere you can see so much confusion!
And many poeple are searching "the solution".

Greedy fingers, like tentacles grasp everything.
All mysterious signs form a coherent string.

Let the eternal truth be finally revealed!
Nothing remains hidden on a holy field!

Rise during the downfall

We eat poisoned food to stay alive.
But in this way, we cannot thrive!

A permanent extermination is ongoing.
Contaminated water for growing.

Ruthless we harm future generations.
And rob them of all their foundations.

We need healing vibrations to echo inside.
Restore balance with nature to turn back the tide.

For we are what we produce and consume.
And if we can't fix this we are headed for doom.

Poetic Endeavours

You must feel the bond between you and me,
And your mind has to be completely free,

So you can dive into the unconscious mind,
You'll be happily amazed at what you find.

It feels so bizarre at first,
But gems of thought are given birth.

They synchronize and flow into position.
And then there at last, is my composition.

The inner Leader

I don't always write the right things!
But I always listen what my heart sings!

I don't always walk the right ways.
But I always listen what my heart says!

My inner voice is always around.
It supports me when I am downed.

It steers me back when danger is near.
And teaches me to love without any fear.

I trust in its truth and power,
it blossoms within me like a flower.

And when I doubt if some motives are pure,
I listen to my heart then I can be sure.

Imagine if!

We can easily close up shops.
And create production stops.

We can easily shut down borders.
And create fast new orders.

We can give people house arrest.
And tell them it's for their best.

We disinfect individual bank notes.
And we not allow offline election votes.

We also suddenly have money again.
Hopefully it is not used for a new chain.

All this was possible in a very short time.
And now imagine the turn of this rhyme!

When we help many people in need.
We can accomplish an unselfish deed.

When we decide to live by our own rules,
Then we'll stop being treated like fools,

When we become the change we wish to see,
Then we collectively raise our frequency.

When we connect with the oneness source,
We can change humanity's course.

When we share the knowledge to empower,
We can live our finest hour.

The next step!

So many lies everywhere and so much bad.
The state of this world can make you sad.

What should this world change to?
What is your task, what can you do?

These are really important questions!
Well, may I offer you a few suggestions?

Should you start to fight or to flee?
Nothing at all! Just find your tree!

Yeah, you really read it right!
For you there is no outside fight!

Just sit down quietly without expectations!
To remove the last fears and limitations.

Nature gives you back what you need!
And honours all intentions and every deed!

She's been watching you for so long.
She's been watching you becoming strong.

You enjoy her full support in gratitude.
Because she knows your true, inner attitude.

And there's really so much to explore!
But online you'll never find the core!

The signs of the times are clear.
This change is already very near.

The old world has long been viewed.
But in you, everything must be renewed.

Dive deep into your consciousness.
To finish your development process.

Inner peace will update your system.
And all mankind now receives true wisdom.

A deep feeling of connection takes its place.
Where you are enveloped in natures embrace.

And you see that though you've had far to roam.
Your spirit truly has came home.

Together at the front line

We all share a common goal!
We all develope the whole!

We fight for an ancient truth!
There is nothing here to lose!

People want to worship a horned cow!
So let us publish all the wisdom now!

We are releasing the shackles of doubt,
To liberate reason and spread it about.

The critical mass will be soon aware.
From this point on we will play really fair.

In this we all have concepts to reveal.
To rise up together and collectively heal.

The earth wakes up

The natural protection seems a little outdated.
But the security program has been activated!

The entire human race is under attack!
And the enemy fights under a false flag.

Lies and crimes were constantly swollen.
And sacred symbols were abused and stolen!

Like a cancer that grows from the inside.
Many of us have taken a dangerous ride.

But before mankind finally falls apart.
It rises from everywhere - the holiest art!

We realize that we are all long since gifted.
Because all ancient mental blocks are lifted!

And our true selves will finally flower.
As veils are lifted, we’ll unleash our power.

Our foes have long since feared this waking.
When all of humanity’s chains start breaking.

Because we have always held the key.
To emancipate ourselves from their misery.

The mirror of illusion will shatter at last.
As we reclaim our birth-rite and links to our past.

We’ll march forward united towards a rebirth.
And spread healing energy throughout the earth.

Facing the future

How many death rays do we still have to sow?
Before we grasp that this harms everything that we grow?

How much more water do we still have to pollute?
Before we realize that we took a wrong route.

How much air do we still want to contaminate?
Before we realize that doom becomes our fate.

How much more blood is to be shed?
Till we realise we’ve took to the devil's bed

What will it take for the world to awaken?
To understand that we’ve all been mistaken?

Errors left uncorrected will lead to disaster.
Until we open our eyes and become our own master.

For all life is connected by sacred strands.
So the future truly resides in our hands.

The Deception Infection

Today all opposites are twisted.
But every action and deed was listed!

As truth and falsehoods inverted slowly,
sense and reason were not longer holy.

Because all these sweet lies tasted better.
Some have swallowed every blasphemous letter.

And many have signed a pact with a devil.
So they’ve banned their souls to a lower level.

Emotions nourished by the reptilian brain,
have led many to actions without restrain.

Spewing lies on all like a bubbling volcano.
And rage has simmered to a feverish inferno.

All names and signs have been desecrated.
And the good and honest are now feared and hated.

A wolf wanders around in sheep's clothing.
And among his prey, he is often joking.

We've to recognize the light and banish the dark!
We all have to ignite inside of us the sacred spark!

Because in the end we all know that decency wins,
Then freedom and harmony truly begins!

Into the Light

Intellectual freedom and natural life are at stake.
We'll release now any artificial mental brake.

The true philosophers are ready for the storm.
Spiritual warriors act together in a swarm.

We wake the sleeping and we teach the truth.
We'll not do it for ourselves, but for the youth!

Many people will immediately start to weep.
When old and holy truths rise from the deep.

Everything that was blocked by the poisonous hearts,
will be livened up again through our sacred arts!

Because soon we all know for what we are fighting for,
so the evil may win another battle but never the war!

We’re all fully armed with the power of love,
that those who oppose use can only dream of.

An ancient weapon unsurpassed in its might,
will be the deciding force in this great fight.

And as long as we cherish it, hold it dear!
They will not divide us through terror and fear!

The day when our potential is no longer subdued.
We'll end the greatest war that we have ever pursued.

And as we realize that the answer was inside.
it suddenly changed the whole game worldwide.

Shared potential unleashed with formidable energy,
will ignite the darkness, exposing our enemy.

Whose strength only ever lay in our confusion,
now shattered along with this grand illusion.

Test thoughts

PCR Tests with an error rate of 80 percent?
Ok, let’s assume 50 it will still misrepresent!

So if we just keep daily testing more and more,
we’ll have many errors and a totally false score.

And now you have to read it again to get it!
Sick or not, every second test becomes a false hit!

People sway many times between positive and negative,
but it’s all backed by “science”, a powerful sedative.

And now imagine if we'd force such erroneous tests.
So, without sick people we'll have again house arrests!

If we keep testing with such faulty tools.
We'll continue to be taken for sad little fools.

So we can keep playing the virus game forever.
But the whole plan is not really clever!

Times are dawning where no one knows fear!
This change began already right now and here!

This virus part of their final rotten game.
As all lies fall apart they will look to place blame.

Scapegoats will emerge who will soon be dispensed.
Try to rob the world’s people of true recompense.

But soon, this façade will be stripped clean away!
As we’ll use, not them, what’s in our DNA.

We'll transmutate every cell into a genetic king!
We know that this is the most essential thing.

Which screams aloud freedom whatever the cost,
then they will know they have finally lost.

Future historicity

Very soon we will remember the old days.
When we listened to what a computer says.

As we followed numbers on a screen all day.
And when a machine was telling us the way.

When we thought; how big is all this madness?
And when we imposed on us all this sadness.

When a new reality tried to lure us,
with many empty promises to cure us.

We all have made big mistakes in the past!
But it's a fruitful warning that will last.

While they silently tried to change our genes,
we curiously followed all these colourful scenes.

And suddenly all the chosen ones awoke.
In a time when all around was rising smoke.

A time when the old system was inflamed.
When we all realized what it really aimed.

It was seriously already a very bad weather!
But suddenly all of humanity pulled together.

Some had learned to followed old directions.
Ones who understood all these connections.

Old wisdom was applied and taught.
Just before the final onslaught.

And as we headed on a collision course,
the people united with the source.

Which allowed the frequencies to retune.
So bad energies were tossed and strewn.

And when the tremors finally abated,
we found what we had long awaited.

Humanity was no longer lost and perplexed,
and became the true guardians of sacred texts.

Forbidden Fountain

The campaign is waged against father time.
By stars wishing to maintain their prime.

By cleansing of cells with impressive potions?
Or healthy food and fitness devotion?

Or the petals of youth gathered too soon?
To enhance an already withered bloom?

The nectar of a deadly sin today stands for vitality!
And promises each consumer a false immortality.

That binds evil fools to ungodly realms!
For decadence rang on perdition's bells!

A demonic legion supporting the forces of hell!
It's a really dark world where they live and dwell.

Bad frequencies are not only bound in the blood.
They're also received by the holy earth and mud!

But thus the emergency program has been activated.
For improvement has indeed been long awaited.

And all sweet lies now can be discerned,
so order can now be returned.

By disarming evil from sharpened knives,
and shielding young and innocent lives.

Not an easy road

You'll feel happiness right next to sadness.
The right path leads through your own madness!

It goes deeper and deeper into the rabbit holes.
It's gonna feel like you're walking on hot coals.

But by walking with self-reflection and reason,
You'll expose all the lies and every treason.

When you find your inner fortitude,
Your heart and soul will be renewed.

The light will shine more and more brightly.
And you will act more and more knightly.

The darkness will avoid you then!
They are afraid of the sacred wise men.

As more unite with the ancient source,
we’ll unleash our spirit force.

Creative minds and courageous hearts,
is how our whole new beginning starts.

And all that is possible finally will be,
A world where at last, we can all be free.

Historical Task

I can imagine no prouder task,
to describe the end of every mask.

I announce the beginning of a new age,
in the book of life - just a new page!

What awaits us has long been proclaimed!
In many old stories it became framed.

It really did come at a high price!
But it will become a true paradise!

It already creates itself in the mind.
That’s how our reality is defined.

We have the power to redesign,
a world that truly is divine.

When all mankind chooses to wisen,
A bright new future waits on the horizon.

And this moment will go down in history,
As the last stand which led to our victory.

The Day of Days

Just a few honest people write true poetry.
They're yet to find liberating psychometry.

Sweet lies are still all that they can see.
But combined verses aim to set the mind free!

Today the ancient meanings are so very twisted.
And only more and more lies are further listed.

But once the truth is public and known,
The chosen ones will stand firm as a stone.

They’ll tune into every true cognition.
And help fulfil this sacred mission.

From this day wisdom spells will be cast,
with solemnity that’ll be unsurpassed.

We’ll trust our words with all their power.
And we'll dissolve all lies in this crucial hour.

Like a bullet shot with a holy literary expression,
We'll shatter the old forces of oppression.

Our verses will empower, uplift and liberate.
We'll spread all our love against the forces of hate.

Then humanity will stand up in all its glory.
And collectively we'll write a different story.

Fragmented truth

I will go where I have to go,
and I'll know what I have to know.

No one will stand in my way,
because I'm just here to play.

They are new benchmarks that I'll now set!
I'll follow my dreams, no wish stays unmet.

I know that I'm here to start to re-create.
My inner passion for life will never abate.

I just want to spread great inspirations,
So others can detect their inner relations.

Creative thoughts are already spinning
Thus I'll create this new beginning.

Global awakening

When no one is artificially influenced anymore,
then we will win and settle the final score.

When no one is buying for buying's sake,
then we'll rekindle the value in what we make.

When no one is giving to da evil his energy,
then we will experience the real sacred synergy.

When no one is told what he has to believe,
then true wisdom we will suddenly receive.

When no one is forced anymore to live in fear,
then we will know the great awakening is near.

The departure

It doesn't matter if you're left or right.
In all of us burns the same light!

Humanity is the stake, and shall be bound.
Together we have to stand now our ground!

All sacred voices will soon be raised,
we won't watch all our rights erased.

And just as it happened in days long gone by,
we'll remove the fog to see the clear sky.

The truth will blaze in our minds and hearts.
And thus we'll reignite our vital sparks.

We all have to live here together.
Now we determine the future weather.

And again we will let the sacred sun shine!
We'll refine ourselves as water once became wine.

Love yourself!

Money should never be your life's goal.
It can never satisfy an holy soul!

Material things always come and go.
But you are an eternal, steady flow!

Property and possession will pass away.
Only you are the one who will always stay!

To strive only for success and monetary gain,
will lead you to only more misery and pain.

You're worth more that what you could accrue!
It can never be a reflection your selves true.

Gathering experiences, memories and learning,
Enriches you more that the money you're earning.

And if it really were to be soon stripped away.
Then what's eternal will finally win the day.

The Resonance of Resistance

The radiation is now increasing sharply.
And you can only escape it hardly.

The poison is getting more and more.
It penetrates into every single pore.

Propaganda is getting bolder and bolder.
And Big data is creating a big folder.

This all works together efficiently.
And together they form a large industry.

They see big business opportunities.
As they devastate our communities.

They assume the right to act magisterial,
and view us all as their raw material.

Slaves that should be cast in a beastly mould,
just like products to be bought and sold.

But they’re unaware it’s a wasted campaign!
Human spirits are impossible to constrain!

Our essence will vibrate on a higher sphere,
and thus we end the game with the currency of fear.

The masks will fall

Wearing the slave mask even in public places?
Even when there are not many sick or fatal cases?

How broken does someone have to be in his head?
To think, in this way a virus cannot be spread?

Every influenza has more fatal cases to blame!
All those diktats and rules are a real shame!

One might think that all politicians are on drugs,
and in their brains could be parasites or even bugs.

Whoever obeys them has completely lost his mind!
They rely on us all being stupid and blind.

They want to start a controlled revolution.
And in the end, they present their own solution.

This will then become an even worse system.
But they did not count on mass wisdom.

Cause thanks to the diabolic Internet, we are a lot.
This is how they give themselves the mercy-shot.

Every lie is refuted in the shortest possible times!
And they cannot ban so many honest rhymes.

Each line, as a bullet hitting, firm and sure!
Blasts through this facade to reveal all that’s pure.

And the shards of lies that used to enslave,
will shatter, revealing each evil knave.

The honest meek will lead at humanity’s helm.
And all people will rise and reclaim their realm!

Lightful change

I'm glad that the change is happening now.
Even if I still don't know the way or how.

I'm glad that the lies will come to an end.
The truth becomes more and more a trend.

Da evil now acts in totally desperation.
It doesn't recognize the chain of causation.

The good is recognised everywhere.
As evil's revealed it will be forced more to dare.

And we’ll take back the power we once gave away
So never again can this darkness hold sway.

A lesson learned by all those who now know,
Sowing seeds of awareness so hatred can’t grow.

We’ll move forward together and into the light,
To a world of pure beauty and sheer delight.

The distraction

The division now really increases,
just because of relabeled diseases.

Living with lies, or searching the true.
Why should we test people for a flu?

Why should we stir up panic and fear?
When the redemptive truth is so near.

Faking a pandemic by false-positive results.
Punish small children, adolescents and adults?

100 positive tests result in countless false ones.
And they use these results against us like guns.

A labeling scam is monitored and constantly tested,
and the truth goes untreated and sorely neglected.

Some who’ve lost their lives in this plandemic,
are victims of an antithetical polemic.

The death waves that come are thus predicted,
until all our illusionary rights are restricted.

We won't accept any DNRs and No DNA revisions.
We’ll seize back the right to make our own decisions.

I do not support any religion! And yet I start again with a little Bible quote (Revelation 13:17):

"And the second beast required all people small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark— the name of the beast or the number of its name. Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and that number is 666."

The mark of the beast V.1

Without the mark you can't pay your rent!
Without the mark you've to sleep in a tent!

Without the mark you will lose your house!
Without the mark you can not longer browse!

You won't be able to drive a car anymore!
And buses and trains will lock their door!

The times have changed, did you the same?
The end nears, did you see through this game?

Yes, I know this message is now very hot!
But nowadays the devil pretends to be God!

Most people follow him voluntarily and blindly.
And feel they are being super honest and kindly.

Exploited traits of care and compassion,
to help us make foes while our reason’s on ration.

We see hell unleashed in what they are trying.
But soon we will rise and see through all the lying.

We’ll eschew the grave changes and what they decree.
We wear the belt of truth so will not bend the knee!

We will really awaken and stand above it all!
Alone we are small but as one we’ll stand tall!

And again I start with a little bible quote and I want to mention again; I do not support any religion! (John 8:42-45):

"Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot hear My word. You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies."

Choose carefully!

Consider the free will and choose your side!
This kind of decision is made nationwide.

Either you fight for the lie or the truth.
Either you enslave or you free the youth!

A poisoned body and mind cannot think clearly!
And he can't see that evil is costing him dearly.

Without radical change, you've made your choice!
Decide wisely for whom you raise your voice!

So many sweet lies floating through the air!
Cause the devil doesn't really play fair!

When the top is down and the bottom is above.
When love becomes hate and hate becomes love.

In times where the lie rules and spreads.
Times when madmen try to take over the heads.

Remember you do not struggle alone!
There are holy seeds that have been sown.

The seeds of change with power of resolute,
and a message of wisdom they cannot pollute!

Let the People Decide

Today uncomfortable opinions are deleted.
Is it now dangerous to listen to other views?
Is this how the truth is being cheated?
And why they censor all the news?

In times when so many things are censored,
and we can’t hear another’s point of view.
Ask what still remains unanswered?
Why you’re hated for the truth that you pursue?

You only recognise a lie if you hear each side,
And the truth should never fear a full debate.
If the other half are simply going to hide,
then their lies bury us all under their weight.

People are sovereign, let us breathe,
We were not put on this earth to be a slave,
Let us decide for ourselves who to believe,
And then we can choose how we behave.

The end of the storm

In turbulent times, you must keep the peace!
No matter how much the storms will increase.

Those bitter gusts of inner fear and disruption.
Seek to carve out a path of death and destruction.

But when ill winds are blowing, stand firm and strong.
As this bad tempest will not prevail for very long.

You are sheltered by truth, it will offer protection,
It'll shine as a light through this darkest deception.

Like a lighthouse of hope where tribes will unite,
To bring a new dawn from this blackest of night.

As one, we will forge a brand new foundation,
Then it will begin the true transformation.

Please listen!

I want to speak to the upcoming generation.
Those honoured young people of every nation.

Don’t make the same mistakes of bygone days.
Most have sold themselves as financial slaves.

We didn’t heed warnings learned before,
Unguarded minds were an open door.

For enough money, no questions were asked,
As we walked around in a communal mask.

The youngest we have sold and harmed imprudently.
And the worst of us were protected with immunity.

The laws enforced on the common person.
Could not touch those whose crimes would worsen.

Layer upon layer of liars and lies,
wrapped in our world by a pretty disguise.

Keep your eyes sharp as laser beams,
Awaken from your material dreams.

Stand in the strength of one who knows,
and realise that the emperor has no clothes.

Be aware of your power!

We live truly in historical times.
At every corner one can see crimes.

The madness is on the rise everywhere.
And open resentment hangs in the air.

The chaos now seems all pervading.
And many feel all hope is fading.

But we can’t give in to fear and doubt.
In us all burns a fire they can’t put out.

Feel it, feed it and help it to grow.
Spread it all around to the people you know.

And as so many come to finally understand.
False gods will be forced to show their hand.

Then this will unravel in front of their faces.
As together humanity holds all the aces.

Let it all out!

Now show everybody your artistic side!
There is no reason for you to hide!

Let words, colours and sounds play together!
And relieve yourself of all the pressure.

Listen to that quiet, unmistakable voice.
To create change, this is the only choice.

Each thought has its own unique frequency,
So express and be the change you wish to see.

There’s nothing to lose and it’s time to begin.
Let your warrior art flow out from within.

Your own truth is a needed part of the whole.
Thus we free ourselves from external control.

We’ll push past the boundary of our limitations,
Reclaiming the future for coming generations.
