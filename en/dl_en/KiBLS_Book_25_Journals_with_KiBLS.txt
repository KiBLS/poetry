Getting Ready to Evolve

Listen carefully to the voice of your soul,
it possesses the true meaning of the whole.

Pay attention to the signs around you,
all of them are hints that surround you.

Start to question honestly every feeling,
that way you'll recognize its true meaning.

Don't allow that your demons guide you.
Scrutinize the dark shadows inside you.

Now make amends with your shadow,
walk by its side and use it to grow.

Like good friends who forget their old grief,
and find their inner light and renewed belief.

Intrinsic Insights

Falsified truths resemble a lie!
Not detectable with the naked eye.

Even the mind has problems with it,
who keep it calm can deal better with it.

True wisdom is always sharp as a blade,
but a lie can never reach such a state.

Your truth is the mark of your existence.
No lie is capable to offer it resistance.

So go into yourself and realize who you are!
In that way you're able to heal every scar!

The maze of Existence

In the hopelessness our valour shall shine.
Courage shall rise with every written line.

In times when all seems lost our hearts will glow.
In the middle of decay something new will grow.

Remember that every nightmare has its own ending.
Overcome your fears for a renewed understanding.

From fading memories something new is born!
Just as a young plant grows out from the corn.

Future Message of a Histographer

All the thoughts were suddenly liberated.
Hereby, the sacred cores of man were located.

Everyone recognized his own light right away.
It became colorful what was once gray.

Everyone started to feel their inner might.
For the seed of courage grew in their mind.

As a serpent of fire that flows upwards,
motivated and enlivened by such words.

And suddenly all the chains were broken,
at the moment when the truth was spoken.

Energetic explosion

In such truly dark times you must shine,
in order to experience your own divine.

When all poles are twisted and reversed,
you've to set the example as the first!

For the truth you will be attacked.
But a sacred core can't be cracked.

For the truth you will soon be persecuted.
By a twisted truth innocents are executed.

But no matter how dark the times may seem.
Just keep on holding on to your dream!

The contradictions will come back in balance,
thus you'll achieve an important advance.

All of your energy will be suddenly released,
so you'll feel that your frequency has increased.

You are...

You're what is and what always remains.
One who puts on but also breaks chains.

You're what was and what remains eternal.
The one who has discovered his kernel.

You're the calm and the strength in a storm.
Like all elements reborn in a human form.

You're wonderful from your head to your toes,
Like a beacon that constantly grows.

Your body holds the heaven as well as hell.
Like a master key through your own spell.

You're what often ends and re-begins.
One of many who loses but also wins.

You're the light at the end of a maze.
Like one who can choose many ways.

The big picture

We are truly a common collective.
Each one with a unique perspective.

Different characteristics and ideas.
Different preferences and also fears.

What also differs are our perspectives.
And as a result of that, our objectives.

Our stories only seem to run separately,
in fact, many elements form a complexity.

All these stories together form an entity.
In which you play a role as an identity.

So we all add more colors to the whole.
And each individual thereby plays its role.
