This is a small (but incomplete) overview of external and independent reviews and reports about KiBLS Poetry outside of social media since it would be impossible to link all the shares and reminds of the social media pages. It is possible that some articles disappear over time or websites go offline. I try to keep the list up to date.<br>

<summary>Who or what is KiBLS?</summary>
<div class="answers">KiBLS is a kind of acronym and at the same time a newly formed artificial word. KiBLS started writing poetry privately in 2007.<br>
<br>
On 10.04.2017 KiBLS began to publish his first works freely on the Internet. First only on Steemit and that also only with very moderate interest from the readers. Only a few weeks later, KiBLS found the platform Minds where, to his great surprise, he quickly found many subscribers and a steadily growing readership.<br>
<br>
When the FB censorship wave hit Vietnam, Minds was flooded with new users from Vietnam and KiBLS realized that his poetry was not only popular in the German and English speaking countries, but also with Vietnamese readers. Through sites like Golos and Uptrennd (meanwhile offline), KiBLS realized that his poetry was finding many readers even in Russia and Africa.<br>
<br>
Over time, KiBLS reached well over 8,000 subscribers on Minds alone and began to engage in various censorship-free social media. However, he soon realized that it was very time consuming to publish in many different medias and limited himself to the platform Minds where he already had 8,000 subscribers. This was followed by several articles from various online journals (for example in the "Searchenginejournal" and the Turkish "Teknotomy") in which KiBLS' channel and his poems were recommended.<br>
<br>
Over time, the butterfly and the chessboard became a kind of trademark of KiBLS. Then, in 2021, KiBLS withdrew completely from social media and it became quieter on the internet around his poetry.<br>

<details>
<summary>Where to find the German PDF versions?</summary>
<div class="answers">The PDF versions of the German e-books are still in progress. But the individual .txt files are already ready and can be downloaded under each poem. I am only one person and it is a lot of work to manage this site on my own.</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I write poetry with you as well?</summary>
<div class="answers">It is possible but rather unlikely that I will find the time. I'm always happy to find fellow poets on the internet so vote my posts on social media up a bit, subscribe and comment on my poetry and you'll surely get my attention.</div>
