					I open my eyes, but I do not see anything.<br>
					Everything is so dark, not a hint of a light!<br>
					<br>
					I strive myself, with all courage.<br>
					What am I doing here - is it doing well to me?<br>
					<br>
					Suddenly, I fall down and glide off elegantly.<br>
					Above me, I see now a magnificent cocoon.<br>
					<br>
					I only feel joyfulness and happiness.<br>
					Glorious perfection, piece by piece.<br>
					<br>
					My beauty radiates like thousand suns.<br>
					Because my new journey has begun!<br><br>

					I walk to a beautiful blue lake.<br>
					The ground below me is covered with green clover.<br>
					And take a look over there in the small clearing,<br>
					there grows a 4-leaved clover, such a rare sighting.<br>
					<br>
					Now I lie fully relaxed beside this calm lake,<br>
					nothing hurts my excited spirit now any longer.<br>
					I am lying still and I am thinking<br>
					I ponder and directing.<br>
					<br>
					Around me, I watch at the beauty of nature,<br>
					It affects my tender soul - just like a cure.<br>
					Nothing can stress me at this moment any more.<br>
					Everything that once was so important is now like forgotten.<br><br>

					A few words... They work miracles,<br>
					They're like tinder for my mind.<br>
					<br>
					A few sentences... with beautiful words,<br>
					And my heart wants to hoard all love.<br>
					<br>
					A poem... with such sentences,<br>
					Let me etch all evil.<br>
					<br>
					Now I feel unlimited power,<br>
					the certain power that can handle anything.<br>
					<br>
					She is permanently growing,<br>
					to soon break all axes.<br>
					<br>
					Nothing can stop her then.<br>
					Because she will rule and reign forever.<br>
					<br>
					And is my soul then purified,<br>
					so shall the true birth be soon!<br><br>

					The green meadow blossoms to new life.<br>
					The empty sky forms his artworks.<br>
					My spirit, it lives. My heart, it trembles.<br>
					<br>
					Fresh buds are sprouting. New life is awakening.<br>
					White treasures adorn the view upwards.<br>
					I see a true splendour. I feel a great power.<br>
					<br>
					The true mother and the father remain there.<br>
					They are so far away from here and yet not gone.<br>
					They lead us to a magical place.<br>
					<br>
					Trust the guidance and follow the path.<br>
					Then you can look forward to true grace!<br><br>

					See over there. She wakes up.<br>
					She have slept and rested for a long time.<br>
					<br>
					Now she is truly strong and pure,<br>
					so the evil end will be very soon.<br>
					<br>
					Your power is shrinking more and more.<br>
					Your end is approaching, it helps us a lot.<br>
					<br>
					We got all oppressed and driven,<br>

					No one can follow the true path.<br>
					Everyone will avoid this tough path.<br>
					<br>
					But if one is very old and wise.<br>
					Then one understands the meaning of the long journey.<br>
					<br>
					However, many can follow the tracks.<br>
					Then they know about the rules of the game.<br>
					<br>
					But only an enlightened one will choose the tough path.<br>
					Simple people only unnecessarily torture themselves.<br>
					<br>
					He strides forward with his full heart.<br>
					So that everyone will be able to see it.<br>
					<br>
					The love of God has awakened in him,<br>
					and laughs mischievously at all evil.<br><br>
