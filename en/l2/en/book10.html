					I am not talking about any mystery!<br>
					What I am doing here is writing history!<br>
					<br>
					In me awakened an irrepressible power.<br>
					Right now it is ringing my biggest hour.<br>
					<br>
					The fog lifts and clarity comes in.<br>
					It was long been written that I'll win.<br>
					<br>
					Hypnotically attractive and yet despised.<br>
					Ephemeral and yet forever immortalized.<br>
					<br>
					Just one last awakening, one last strike.<br>
					And everything will work the way I like.<br><br>

					I am enlightened, but what now?<br>
					In this society unprofitable somehow!<br>
					<br>
					Nothing changed, everything stayed the same.<br>
					Everybody just keeps playing their game.<br>
					<br>
					And yet it have changed every goal.<br>
					And mainly my own view of the whole.<br>
					<br>
					I realized that this isn't the end.<br>
					I only dared the first ascent!<br>
					<br>
					The way to the top is finally free.<br>
					That's why many more will follow me.<br>
					<br>
					A new mindset in process of exchanging.<br>
					And thus the whole world is changing.<br><br>

					My mind was strongly sedated.<br>
					And I have never really meditated.<br>
					<br>
					Always done what I thought was right.<br>
					And yet I've never noticed my own light.<br>
					<br>
					So many problems and so few solutions.<br>
					They died painfully; all my illusions.<br>
					<br>
					And at the end, just before the turnaround.<br>
					It was my own insanity which I have found.<br>
					<br>
					My whole self was suddenly disintegrated.<br>
					There was nothing left that could be rated.<br>
					<br>
					And how the butterfly slips out of its cocoon,<br>
					I finally received the greatest boon.<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Philanthropic reformation</b><br><br>
					
					I let my light shine, it will never end!<br>
					Like a firm lighthouse I will never bend!<br>
					<br>
					A bright beam illuminates everything dark.<br>
					It radiates like an igniting spark.<br>
					<br>
					An extensive light is now triggered.<br>
					Each observer will be re-configured.<br>
					<br>
					Selflessness annihilate every frustration.<br>
					Healing begins without any hesitation.<br>
					<br>
					Mankind is acting united with a common goal.<br>
					Philanthropic thoughts working for the whole.<br>
					<br>
					By uncovering the final deception,<br>
					we will all reach true perfection.<br><br>

					A new day is dawning.<br>
					The master is drawing.<br>
					<br>
					Finally found the source.<br>
					Discovered the true force.<br>
					<br>
					All thoughts begin to groove.<br>
					This makes the pen move.<br>
					<br>
					The wisdom appears.<br>
					Just leaving all fears.<br>
					<br>
					Mankind is ready to rise.<br>
					It's a spectacle for all eyes.<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Program correction</b><br><br>
					
					Actually, I'm already crowned.<br>
					Now my mind is racing around.<br>
					<br>
					Does that make me a winner?<br>
					Or am I just a holy sinner?<br>
					<br>
					Words straight from the heart.<br>
					Showing a long forgotten art.<br>
					<br>
					Suppressed truths are just rising.<br>
					They don't need any kind of advertising.<br>
					<br>
					They'll correct simply your basic program.<br>
					Because the old one is steeped in a scam.<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">I've resigned!</b><br><br>
					
					I can no longer pretend for 8 hours a day.<br>
					It is time that I walk my own way!<br>
					<br>
					I have absolutely no idea where I'm going.<br>
					But deep inside I have a reassuring knowing.<br>
					<br>
					My thoughts were tearing me apart inside.<br>
					More than 8 hours a day my inner life died.<br>
					<br>
					Now I wanna leave in peace and let myself fall.<br>
					I surrender to the unknown to finally stand tall.<br>
					<br>
					I will now grow and be wise.<br>
					I will be like a phoenix that rise.<br>
					<br>
					So let my new journey now start!<br>
					From now I'll follow only my heart!<br><br>
