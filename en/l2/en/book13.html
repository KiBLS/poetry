					We're all fighting the same fight!<br>
					We all try to win with our light!<br>
					<br>
					The darkness alone - it cannot shine!<br>
					But light can transform water into wine!<br>
					<br>
					The darkness can never touch the light!<br>
					Because it just radiates so bright!<br>
					<br>
					Only if the light shines weaker sometimes,<br>
					it seems that darkness grows with crimes.<br>
					<br>
					But once the light starts to shine again.<br>
					It will simply shatter every chain.<br>
					<br>
					A big change is drawing near for everyone!<br>
					Nothing is able to block the light of a sun.<br><br>

					In the past we used to call them slave lords.<br>
					Nowadays we talk about entrepreneur hordes.<br>
					<br>
					In the past, we called it contaminated waste.<br>
					Nowadays people eat it and love the taste.<br>

					In the past, we called it toxical affair.<br>

					In the past we all had no idea!<br>

					The greed in many is so deeply rooted.<br>
					Their whole spirit is heavy polluted!<br>
					<br>
					They're just demanding more and more.<br>
					They treat others like a little whore.<br>
					<br>
					So many give so much, but never enough!<br>
					Opressed to work all day in a modern handcuff.<br>
					<br>
					Fortunately, nowadays the whip is forbidden.<br>
					But unfortunately, inner wounds are deeply hidden!<br>
					<br>
					So many people are blinded and degenerated by greed.<br>
					They drive into their abyss with the highest speed!<br><br>
