					The words "come" will fall.<br>
					Then there will be a real bang.<br>

					The great mass has awakened.<br>
					The last fire has kindled.<br>
					<br>
					They break chains and the dungeon.<br>
					Free and unleashed; true berserkers.<br>

					Half mankind is crazy!<br>
					The great purification begins.<br>

					The masses will be united mentally.<br>
					The triumph appears at the horizon.<br>

					The last chapter becomes fulfilled,<br>

					<br>This time I would like to start with a little bible quote even though I am not a supporter of any religion (Quote from "Acts/Joel 2:17"):<br>
					<br>
					>>>> Start of quote:<br>
					<br>
					"No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: In the last days, God says, I will pour out My Spirit on all people; your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. Even on My menservants and maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy."<br>

					<br>I start again with a little Bible quote and I want to emphasise again that I do not support any religion.<br>
					<br>
					>>> Start of the quote (Revelation 13:17):<br>
					<br>
					"And the second beast required all people small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark— the name of the beast or the number of its name. Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and that number is 666."<br>
					<br>
					>>> End of the quote<br>
					<br>
					<br><b class="ptitle">The mark of the beast V.2</b><br><br>
				
					For those who don't yet know what's going on.<br>
					For the times to come, you have to be strong.<br>
					<br>
					Changed from the front of the head to the forehead.<br>
					It's only one forgery that has become widespread.<br>

					You can't buy or sell anything anymore.<br>
					Without selling to the beast as a whore.<br>
					<br>
					The madness is taken to the extreme.<br>
					It's the realisation of an evil dream.<br>
					<br>
					The bio sensor is placed on the right hand.<br>
					For a long time, this was ruthlessly planned!<br>
					<br>
					Genetically modified, you are no longer human.<br>
					To artificial intelligence, you become a crewman.<br>
					<br>
					Free yourself from the grip of darkness.<br>
					For this you'll need a lot of smartness.<br>
					<br>
					Detoxify your body and your mind!<br>
					And it will be freedom that you find.<br><br>
