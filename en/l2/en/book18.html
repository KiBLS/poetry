					This day is now almost over again.<br>
					<br>
					I feel ready for the great transmit!<br>
					When will I be able to feel just some of it?<br>
					<br>
					Please tell me when comes the time?<br>
					When will I be full sublime?<br>
					<br>
					When the evil will burn?<br>
					When will come this great turn?<br>

					But wait! I can now feel it begin.<br>
					The changes are coming from deep within.<br>
					<br>
					And now, at last, I’m starting to see.<br>
					That this great change begins with you and me.<br><br>

					You don't notice your own decay,<br>
					when stress makes your hair turn grey.<br>
					<br>
					Permanently only the time in view.<br>
					Always looking for something new.<br>
					<br>
					Distracted with the daily grind.<br>
					Forgetting how to nourish the mind.<br>
					<br>
					Rushing through life like it is a race.<br>
					Not noticing life’s beauty and grace.<br>
					<br>
					Don’t live in the future, it’s uncertain.<br>
					Be present before it’s the final curtain.<br><br>

					<br>
					She's been watching you for so long.<br>

					<br>
					And there's really so much to explore!<br>

					<br>
					The signs of the times are clear.<br>

					Just a few honest people write true poetry.<br>
					They're yet to find liberating psychometry.<br>
					<br>
					Sweet lies are still all that they can see.<br>
					But combined verses aim to set the mind free!<br>
					<br>
					Today the ancient meanings are so very twisted.<br>
					And only more and more lies are further listed.<br>
					<br>
					But once the truth is public and known,<br>
					The chosen ones will stand firm as a stone.<br>
					<br>
					They’ll tune into every true cognition.<br>
					And help fulfil this sacred mission.<br>
					<br>
					From this day wisdom spells will be cast,<br>
					with solemnity that’ll be unsurpassed.<br>

					We’ll trust our words with all their power.<br>
					And we'll dissolve all lies in this crucial hour.<br>
					<br>
					Like a bullet shot with a holy literary expression,<br>
					We'll shatter the old forces of oppression.<br>
					<br>
					Our verses will empower, uplift and liberate.<br>
					We'll spread all our love against the forces of hate.<br>
					<br>
					Then humanity will stand up in all its glory.<br>
					And collectively we'll write a different story.<br><br>

					You won't be able to drive a car anymore!<br>

					I want to speak to the upcoming generation.<br>
					Those honoured young people of every nation.<br>
					<br>
					Don’t make the same mistakes of bygone days.<br>
					Most have sold themselves as financial slaves.<br>
					<br>
					We didn’t heed warnings learned before,<br>
					Unguarded minds were an open door.<br>
					<br>
					For enough money, no questions were asked,<br>
					As we walked around in a communal mask.<br>
					<br>
					The youngest we have sold and harmed imprudently.<br>
					And the worst of us were protected with immunity.<br>
					<br>
					The laws enforced on the common person.<br>
					Could not touch those whose crimes would worsen.<br>

					Layer upon layer of liars and lies,<br>
					wrapped in our world by a pretty disguise.<br>
					<br>
					Keep your eyes sharp as laser beams,<br>
					Awaken from your material dreams.<br>
					<br>
					Stand in the strength of one who knows,<br>
					and realise that the emperor has no clothes.<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Be aware of your power!</b><br><br>
					
					We live truly in historical times.<br>
					At every corner one can see crimes.<br>
					<br>
					The madness is on the rise everywhere.<br>
					And open resentment hangs in the air.<br>
					<br>
					The chaos now seems all pervading.<br>
					And many feel all hope is fading.<br>
					<br>
					But we can’t give in to fear and doubt.<br>
					In us all burns a fire they can’t put out.<br>
					<br>
					Feel it, feed it and help it to grow.<br>
					Spread it all around to the people you know.<br>
					<br>
					And as so many come to finally understand.<br>
					False gods will be forced to show their hand.<br>
					<br>
					Then this will unravel in front of their faces.<br>
					As together humanity holds all the aces.<br><br>

					Now show everybody your artistic side!<br>
					There is no reason for you to hide!<br>
					<br>
					Let words, colours and sounds play together!<br>
					And relieve yourself of all the pressure.<br>
					<br>
					Listen to that quiet, unmistakable voice.<br>
					To create change, this is the only choice.<br>
					<br>
					Each thought has its own unique frequency,<br>
					So express and be the change you wish to see.<br>
					<br>
					There’s nothing to lose and it’s time to begin.<br>
					Let your warrior art flow out from within.<br>
					<br>
					Your own truth is a needed part of the whole.<br>
					Thus we free ourselves from external control.<br>
					<br>
					We’ll push past the boundary of our limitations,<br>
					Reclaiming the future for coming generations.<br><br>
