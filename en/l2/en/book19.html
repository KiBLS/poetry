					All your dreams are suddenly taken.<br>

					We all slept so long and nicely.<br>

					Amazing times are about to dawn.<br>

					You are pure nature and all-knowing!<br>
					Develop yourself and keep on growing!<br>
					<br>
					A mosaic is formed by many pieces.<br>
					And new clarity constantly increases.<br>
					<br>
					He who controls the present, writes the past!<br>
					And so he can also change the future very fast!<br>
					<br>
					Only here at this moment you are in control.<br>
					Come, I'll show you how to reach your goal.<br>
					<br>
					I'll show you how to cross borders and grow.<br>
					What do you like? What do you want to know?<br>
					<br>
					Sit down for a while and make yourself comfortable.<br>
					Because under stress or too loose you are vulnerable!<br>

					Just pay attention to your breath and relax your mind.<br>
					Close your eyes and it is peace that you will find!<br>
					<br>
					Now your mind can connect easily with "all that is".<br>
					Mind structures are created and you experience a bliss!<br>
					<br>
					A short time later all the answers will fall to you!<br>
					But believe me, this simple trick is nothing new!<br>
					<br>
					This was known so long before and everybody knew it!<br>
					But also in this case; our modern society blew it!<br>
					<br>
					So roll up your sleeves and sit down!<br>
					You just have to wait for your crown!<br><br>

					I've seen so long all the misery.<br>
					And thus I lifted the last mystery.<br>
					<br>
					The desperation was so deep in me.<br>
					I felt the opposite of being free.<br>
					<br>
					But when the chains got too tight,<br>
					they were broken by a shining light.<br>
					<br>
					I had no external help, no prospect, no savior.<br>
					And suddenly, one little moment changed my behavior.<br>
					<br>
					The moment when the genius pushes its bounds.<br>
					Immediately the consciousness plays new sounds.<br>
					<br>
					Finally I've seen some kind of empty spaced corona!<br>
					And that immediately erased every old persona.<br><br>

					I remember when I was a small boy.<br>
					We often used the forest as a toy!<br>
					<br>
					We built many forts and shacks.<br>
					And wandered off the beaten tracks.<br>
					<br>
					We have built dikes along small streams!<br>
					And briefly we lived according to our dreams.<br>
					<br>
					How quickly these times have now faded.<br>
					Today this old time looks like grey shaded.<br>
					<br>
					Today it's all about money and time.<br>
					Everybody's always chasing the next dime.<br>
					<br>
					The joy and curiosity of the people is numb.<br>
					And they have no idea where they're from.<br>

					While I wandered around, I was still a sleeper.<br>
					And the path led me down only ever deeper.<br>

					<br>
					I wandered a long time through the dark.<br>

					<br>
					I have seen through the eternal deception.<br>

					And it's good that Robocop is still in his garage!<br>
					I'm sure he was only built for a pleasant massage.<br>
					<br>
					They still have not yet created the real beast!<br>
					But it will rage not only from west to east!<br>
					<br>
					I really have nothing good to announce today.<br>
					But I'd like to share a "crude idea" about the way.<br>
					<br>
					Dear sleepers! The coming times will not become great!<br>
					Together we'll stand in hell at the famous gate.<br>
					<br>
					So many still try to save their own hoard.<br>
					And many more cry and call for the false lord!<br>

					Your financial worries will be a thing of the past.<br>
					And maybe just a memory of your old life will last!<br>
					<br>
					Your new freedom is to serve under your true master.<br>
					But surprise, now you're owned by the Lord of Distaster!<br>
					<br>
					Now you have to stay strong and endure 1000 years!<br>
					You can still listen from afar to our cries of cheers.<br>
					<br>
					Two realities! Satan's followers and humanity!<br>
					Now you must for real choose with sanity!<br><br>

					How can I describe something that nobody understands?<br>
					Something that never really began and never ends?<br>
					<br>
					Something that has no form and nobody could ever kill.<br>
					Something that's more powerful than any red pill?<br>
					<br>
					Today no one can still interpret the ancient truth!<br>
					Old people teach great humbug to an unwitting youth.<br>
					<br>
					But I want to try to enlighten everything!<br>
					Believe me it will become fascinating!<br>
					<br>
					A bright and yet dark sun is the eternal source!<br>
					It created everything and is the elemental force.<br>

					It's simply everything and yet absolutely nothing.<br>
					It makes no difference between a beggar or a king.<br>

					It takes away all your fears and anxieties.<br>
					And erases your old self from all societies.<br>
					<br>
					It shines out of you and its power is eternal!<br>
					It's the true and inexhaustible kernel.<br>
					<br>
					The inner sun is known under many names nowadays!<br>

					In all countries, old religions and ancient scriptures.<br>
					Everywhere inside this world you can find the pictures!<br>

					You can read it in my sacred rhymes!<br>
					<br>
					The holy primal light announces the golden age.<br>
					In the Book of Life, the Aquarius opens a new page.<br>
					<br>
					The world cries out for the holy quake!<br>
					So the all-philosopher will soon really awake!<br>
					<br>
					This doomed system will go down in flames.<br>
					We're removing any artificial thought frames.<br>
					<br>
					From the ashes will rise the kingdom of the sun.<br>
					For everyone it'll be a long and arduous run!<br>
					<br>
					But what is created this time will last long times!<br>
					Because this time truth is protected by sacred rhymes!<br><br>

					The black sun had many different names.<br>
					It's knowledge and wisdom that it claims.<br>
					<br>
					Ancient religions show its holy pictures.<br>
					And it's written about in old scriptures.<br>
					<br>
					The black sun heralds the new age.<br>
					In the Book of life it opens a new page.<br>
					<br>
					In Egypt her name was Sothislight.<br>
					And even in the Edda it shines bright.<br>
					<br>
					Sajaha, the first seer of Babylon knew it.<br>
					Even Christ's ascension day points to it.<br>
					<br>
					It is symbolised by those black stones.<br>
					And she shows to who this world owns.<br>
					<br>
					The Light of wisdom, knowledge and more.<br>
					The chosen one does not behave like a whore.<br>

					The new Sun King was always crowned by her.<br>
					Because he will easily expose every liar!<br>
					<br>
					It is in Buddhism, Islam and all religions.<br>
					But also in national flags and old traditions.<br>
					<br>
					From the Pisces to the Age of Aquarius.<br>
					Every other defintion would be hilarious!<br>
					<br>
					But this knowledge is still hidden and secret!<br>
					But it goes back even further than only Egypt.<br>
					<br>
					Da evil tries to disguise this information!<br>
					But you can find its source in every nation!<br>
					<br>
					Now the black sun is again shining.<br>
					Thus the new age made its signing.<br><br>
