					We're like an eternal and holy formation!<br>
					Together we bring that transformation!<br>
					<br>
					We Even agree when we disagree.<br>
					And we'll never bend the knee!<br>
					<br>
					In the past we were all stifled and chained.<br>
					Now our mental powers rise unrestrained.<br>
					<br>
					Our minds were the tools we hadn't explored.<br>
					But now useless thoughts will be ignored.<br>
					<br>
					Knowledge we learned had so many flaws.<br>
					So we started our search about the cause.<br><br>

					So many ways to choose but I walk mine!<br>
					I follow it and observe every sign.<br>
					<br>
					Unimpressed, I saw the evil side.<br>
					There every truth was only denied.<br>
					<br>
					Memories appeared through sacred signs.<br>
					And so I began to write true lines.<br>
					<br>
					In my centre I've found the source.<br>
					I feel increasing waves of the force.<br>
					<br>
					A hidden spark I found. I've freed the light.<br>
					And it helped me to enjoy a major sight.<br>
					<br>
					I turned myself to the essence of love,<br>
					thus I received the blessing from above.<br>
					<br>
					Inwardly satisfied and fully delighted.<br>
					At last I could feel completely united.<br><br>

					<br>
					Our lights start to shine unmistakable.<br>
					Our subconsciousness is unshakable.<br>

					Do not cling to your ego or name!<br>

					A new story board, on a green screen,<br>

					Finally we have to go out to explore.<br>
					To realize that truth is providing more.<br><br>

					We bring the truth to light again.<br>

					Completely unaffected by human debates.<br>

					And so we finally leave the gaming zone.<br><br>

					Inside me lies every contradiction.<br>
					Because outside, everything is fiction.<br>
					<br>
					The imagination creates perception.<br>
					And yet everything is a deception.<br>
					<br>
					Only a few recognise the eternal true.<br>
					Their own delusion they had to go through.<br>
					<br>
					To finally overcome their own sadness.<br>
					They just climbed up their own madness.<br>
					<br>
					It is sad to see where we have been.<br>
					So obvious now, we have all seen.<br>
					<br>
					We'll help those who have fallen behind.<br>
					We'll encourage those who did not yet find.<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Zodiacal distortion</b><br><br>
					
					An antient description of the zodiac.<br>
					An antient description is coming back.<br>
					<br>
					In the endless sky it was always known,<br>
					as the circle of tiny animals it was shown.<br>
					<br>
					Everthing revolve around the way.<br>
					The way we are, the way to be today.<br>
					<br>
					It is the way and manner how we talk.<br>
					Words and sounds that learn to walk.<br>
					<br>
					Everyone knows the antient zodiac view.<br>
					When it's shown to someone it's not new.<br>
					<br>
					Distort facts with half-truths, an old trick.<br>
					This way they hid the way from the public.<br><br>
