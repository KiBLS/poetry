					Know thyself is the most essential!<br>
					In order to enable your full potential.<br>
					<br>
					Question honestly all your intentions!<br>
					To remove all previous preventions.<br>
					<br>
					Who are you and where are you going?<br>
					Just observe your own style of growing.<br>
					<br>
					Your decisions were always right!<br>
					Your past reflects your might.<br>
					<br>
					There is nothing right or wrong!<br>
					And neither weak nor strong!<br>
					<br>
					There's only that which is eternal.<br>
					And that is your true kernel.<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Extensive truthfulness</b><br><br>
					
					Your ego will be completely wiped out.<br>
					In this way something new can sprout.<br>
					<br>
					Through constant scrutiny and observation.<br>
					You will experience a true transformation.<br>
					<br>
					The veil of mist is completely dissolved.<br>
					And every bad illusion will be involved.<br>
					<br>
					Your mind will be completely rearranged.<br>
					And thereby the whole world will be changed.<br>
					<br>
					The old will make way for the new.<br>
					The false will go to create the true.<br>
					<br>
					This change will not be easy of course.<br>
					But thus you will reach the true source.<br>
					<br>
					There is a harmony between good and bad weather.<br>
					All is part of the whole and works together.<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Controlled time</b><br><br>
					
					The consciousness changes its perception.<br>
					Thus originates the timeline deception.<br>
					<br>
					Every single second the mind wanders.<br>
					This is how you can discover true wonders.<br>
					<br>
					Every new moment creates a new illusion.<br>
					Deliberated time can be a real confusion.<br>
					<br>
					All possibilities are already available.<br>
					Through your own mind they are scalable.<br>
					<br>
					Your mind is the most powerful tool in existence!<br>
					It can easily overcome any time and distance.<br>
					<br>
					Learn to see the entire image without rating!<br>
					Your true self will be the one you are dating.<br><br>
