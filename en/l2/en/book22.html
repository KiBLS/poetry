					Cover your butt with nappies that are well fitted.<br>
					Because the "zombie epidemic" is thus transmitted.<br>
					<br>
					It's about the aerosols from the butt.<br>
					And now you really might ask; what?<br>
					<br>
					Do not wear skirts or fart without pants!<br>
					Don't give this "evil virus" a chance.<br>
					<br>
					The zombie epidemic aerosols are transmitted by farts.<br>
					Protect your friends by wearing a nappy with hearts.<br>
					<br>
					Vaccination is love and masks for above and below.<br>
					How to protect yourself properly should everyone know.<br><br>

					You are not alone, we're the majority!<br>

					Sometimes poems write themselves automatically.<br>
					Verses just creates completely spontaneously.<br>
					<br>
					There are times when I write so much,<br>
					each line can then trigger a deep touch.<br>
					<br>
					But lack of oxygen and too much radiation,<br>
					can cause a strong and long stagnation.<br>
					<br>
					Poisons and distractions also do their job.<br>
					and can lead in the end to a big flop.<br>
					<br>
					Therefore I detox my own body every day,<br>
					and chlorine dioxide escorts me on my way.<br>
					<br>
					I provide myself with the necessary nourishment.<br>
					In this way I achieve a complete refurbishment.<br>

					Clarity prevails in my thoughts.<br>
					I've won where I've inwardly fought.<br>
					<br>
					No one can fool me anymore.<br>
					The truth is what I stand for.<br>
					<br>
					Only my dreams I will now pursue.<br>
					I'll separate the false from the true.<br>
					<br>
					Imagination mixes soon with reality.<br>
					The positive change is what I see.<br>
					<br>
					I go out only with the goal in mind.<br>
					What I was chasing for I'll find.<br>
					<br>
					And when I have finally found,<br>
					I'll live in an eternal compound.<br><br>

					Always produce, consume and recycle.<br>

					No one questions the madness.<br>

					<br>
					As a producer you see only digits.<br>
					You miss in between connecting bridges.<br>
					<br>
					It can be hard to recognise the humour,<br>
					as long as I'm forced to be a consumer.<br>
					<br>
					What is consumed is ultimately recycled.<br>
					And everywhere it is as free life titled.<br>
