					Should I go now or stay.<br>
					I only crave my own way.<br>
					<br>
					This change is such a big step.<br>
					Far away from the World Wide Web.<br>
					<br>
					I might miss some stuff.<br>
					And the path will be tough.<br>
					<br>
					But if I think like this<br>
					and keep acting without bliss.<br>
					<br>
					I will never get to run.<br>
					And never discover real fun.<br>
					<br>
					So here and now i make an holy vow,<br>
					to walk from the realm of the golden sow.<br>
					<br>
					To enter the world of truth and reality,<br>
					to find myself, my love and my sanity!<br><br>

					Even a well-meant lie remains a lie,<br>
					but hence the truth will never die!<br>
					<br>
					The truth does not need to boast.<br>
					For it spreads from coast to coast.<br>
					<br>
					Across the lands it will be recognized.<br>
					And only among liars It'll be despised.<br>
					<br>
					An endless game to deceive the rival,<br>
					but it only works until truth's revival.<br>
					<br>
					Now we all see an honest era coming again,<br>
					and this suddenly changes the evil reign.<br>
					<br>
					When we recognize our counterpart again as friend,<br>
					then hope and truth rise and all deceptions end.<br><br>

					Deep insights are what I am giving.<br>

					If I carefully listen, the nature will speak!<br>

					One domino just knocks over the next.<br>
					Like one after another reads this text.<br>
					<br>
					A single thought can be so strong,<br>
					that all stones in a line fall along!<br>
					<br>
					Our thoughts and actions will spread,<br>
					by our visions and dreams we're led.<br>
					<br>
					Dreams are realised piece by piece,<br>
					and thus doubts will greatly decrease.<br>
					<br>
					Just like a small seed grows to become a plant.<br>
					And through the rain constantly gains a grant.<br>
					<br>
					If one is looking ahead, one can easily see,<br>
					a wise drop changes the structure of the sea!<br><br>

					Do you want to live with fears forever?<br>
					And question established things never?<br>
					<br>
					Do you want to let your mind be abused?<br>
					And thus your own potential lie unused?<br>
					<br>

					And start sorting out the strings.<br>
					<br>
					It's hard work untying these knots!<br>
					to do so you must re-learn a lot!<br>
					<br>
					Unlearn too, the lies you were told,<br>
					to keep your soul from being sold.<br>
					<br>
					Put away your fears and face the truth.<br>
					And of your sacred mind, make a use!<br>
					<br>
					Together we can tear down walls.<br>
					So in the end every evil mask falls.<br><br>

					A lie only needs to be repeated often enough,<br>
					but even then a duck cannot become a dove.<br>
					<br>
					Propaganda is constantly played up and down,<br>
					so one can portray trashy people with a crown.<br>
					<br>
					You can deceive many people for a long time!<br>
					But a squawk will never become a clear chime!<br>
					<br>
					A theater game that so many play for a while.<br>
					But at some point you even lose the own smile.<br>
					<br>
					Don't be discouraged, it is and remains a game!<br>
					To see through these lies should be your aim!<br>
					<br>
					Over time, the lie will expose on its own.<br>
					Because the eternal truth was always known.<br><br>
