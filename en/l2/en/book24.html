					You need not only a wish, but also desire!<br>

					What you desire, that will come to pass!<br>

					Grumbling and hypocrisy are in fashion.<br>
					Nowadays, many have found this a passion.<br>
					<br>
					He who acts hypocritically also acts wrongly!<br>
					And feels inwardly torn and less strongly!<br>
					<br>
					The one who is always only grumbling,<br>
					can often feel a strong humbling.<br>
					<br>
					Search and find your inner peace!<br>
					And your contentment will increase.<br>
					<br>
					Find within you what you're looking for!<br>
					In this way you will find more and more.<br>
					<br>
					Understanding will grow and thrive!<br>
					And that will change your entire life!<br><br>

					All doctors experience intense shocks,<br>
					because chlorine dioxide that rocks.<br>
					<br>
					Big pharma is worried about its sales,<br>
					because the results are no fairy tales!<br>
					<br>
					Whether it's cancer, an allergy, or the flu.<br>
					whoever knows it, changes his health view.<br>
					<br>
					Almost everything can be cured so fast,<br>
					because it causes health that lasts.<br>
					<br>
					Even the evil corona virus takes flight.<br>
					For CD is victorious without a big fight.<br>
					<br>
					But the media can make you feel insecure.<br>
					For they insist that it isn't a miracle cure.<br>

					Don't let them sell you an apple for a pear!<br>
					About true health you've to become aware.<br>
					<br>
					He who's good in seeking, will finally find.<br>
					Two substances needs to be simply combined.<br>
					<br>
					What comes out is not toxic, it's different.<br>
					And that is salutary and highly efficient.<br><br>

					We are like gullible birds in cages,<br>
					we all were caged over eons of ages.<br>
					<br>
					Genuine freedom - we did not know.<br>
					Before our eyes we enjoyed a show.<br>
					<br>
					Our cages promised us good protection,<br>
					and we adored this shelter projection.<br>
					<br>
					Suddenly everything begins to change,<br>
					cage doors open and that seems strange.<br>
					<br>
					Now we notice the real world out there,<br>
					and we realize it's neither safe nor fair.<br>
					<br>
					We'll receive no shelter or food any longer.<br>
					But self-responsible we will become stronger.<br>

					For outside is so much beauty to explore.<br>
					We just have to step out of the open door.<br>

					Write down everything that is burdening you.<br>
					This is how you create a perceptive view.<br>
					<br>
					Just write all your problems off your chest.<br>
					In the process, be honest and give your best!<br>
					<br>
					Your inner thoughts are projected outward,<br>
					This is how you go step by step forward.<br>
					<br>
					The whole process is called self-reflection.<br>
					So know thyself and get out of the deception.<br>
					<br>
					Read it, improve it, and keep on to reflect.<br>
					And keep going even if it appears suspect.<br>
					<br>
					Who knows himself becomes self-confident,<br>
					and thus can walk his path with competence.<br>
					<br>
					No one can ever seduce or lie to you anymore!<br>
					On this way you open the most important door!<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Question everything!</b><br><br>
					
					The things that are the most criticized,<br>
					must always be most carefully analyzed!<br>
					<br>
					Scrutinize profoundly every public claim,<br>
					and with "hidden truths" - do the same!<br>
					<br>
					For he who once has heard every lie,<br>
					can detect the truth with his own eye.<br>

					Stinging nettle is the best plant for survival.<br>
					In this area, the plant has only a few rivals.<br>
					<br>
					It has many proteins and is rich in nutrition.<br>
					Also as a medicinal plant it fulfills a mission.<br>
					<br>
					It is useful like hemp but grows like weed.<br>
					And it spreads everywhere with a high speed.<br>
					<br>
					But also dandelion and daisies are digestible.<br>
					In nature, this is all free of charge testable.<br>
					<br>
					Also many of the known tree leaves are edible.<br>
					Anyone who learns this finds it is incredible.<br>
					<br>
					There are also mushrooms and medicinal plants.<br>
					It takes not much time until one understands.<br>
