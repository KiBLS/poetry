					Listen carefully to the voice of your soul,<br>
					it possesses the true meaning of the whole.<br>
					<br>
					Pay attention to the signs around you,<br>
					all of them are hints that surround you.<br>
					<br>
					Start to question honestly every feeling,<br>
					that way you'll recognize its true meaning.<br>
					<br>
					Don't allow that your demons guide you.<br>
					Scrutinize the dark shadows inside you.<br>
					<br>
					Now make amends with your shadow,<br>
					walk by its side and use it to grow.<br>
					<br>
					Like good friends who forget their old grief,<br>
					and find their inner light and renewed belief.<br><br>

					Falsified truths resemble a lie!<br>
					Not detectable with the naked eye.<br>
					<br>
					Even the mind has problems with it,<br>
					who keep it calm can deal better with it.<br>
					<br>
					True wisdom is always sharp as a blade,<br>
					but a lie can never reach such a state.<br>
					<br>
					Your truth is the mark of your existence.<br>
					No lie is capable to offer it resistance.<br>
					<br>
					So go into yourself and realize who you are!<br>
					In that way you're able to heal every scar!<br><br>

					In the hopelessness our valour shall shine.<br>
					Courage shall rise with every written line.<br>
					<br>
					In times when all seems lost our hearts will glow.<br>
					In the middle of decay something new will grow.<br>
					<br>
					Remember that every nightmare has its own ending.<br>
					Overcome your fears for a renewed understanding.<br>
					<br>
					From fading memories something new is born!<br>
					Just as a young plant grows out from the corn.<br><br>

					All the thoughts were suddenly liberated.<br>
					Hereby, the sacred cores of man were located.<br>
					<br>
					Everyone recognized his own light right away.<br>
					It became colorful what was once gray.<br>
					<br>
					Everyone started to feel their inner might.<br>
					For the seed of courage grew in their mind.<br>
					<br>
					As a serpent of fire that flows upwards,<br>
					motivated and enlivened by such words.<br>
					<br>
					And suddenly all the chains were broken,<br>
					at the moment when the truth was spoken. <br><br>

					In such truly dark times you must shine,<br>
					in order to experience your own divine.<br>
					<br>
					When all poles are twisted and reversed,<br>
					you've to set the example as the first!<br>
					<br>
					For the truth you will be attacked.<br>
					But a sacred core can't be cracked.<br>
					<br>
					For the truth you will soon be persecuted.<br>
					By a twisted truth innocents are executed.<br>
					<br>
					But no matter how dark the times may seem.<br>
					Just keep on holding on to your dream!<br>
					<br>
					The contradictions will come back in balance,<br>
					thus you'll achieve an important advance.<br>
					<br>
					All of your energy will be suddenly released,<br>
					so you'll feel that your frequency has increased.<br><br>

					You're what is and what always remains.<br>
					One who puts on but also breaks chains.<br>
					<br>
					You're what was and what remains eternal.<br>
					The one who has discovered his kernel.<br>
					<br>
					You're the calm and the strength in a storm.<br>
					Like all elements reborn in a human form.<br>
					<br>
					You're wonderful from your head to your toes,<br>
					Like a beacon that constantly grows.<br>
					<br>
					Your body holds the heaven as well as hell.<br>
					Like a master key through your own spell.<br>
					<br>
					You're what often ends and re-begins.<br>
					One of many who loses but also wins.<br>
					<br>
					You're the light at the end of a maze.<br>
					Like one who can choose many ways.<br><br>

					We are truly a common collective.<br>
					Each one with a unique perspective.<br>
					<br>
					Different characteristics and ideas.<br>
					Different preferences and also fears.<br>
					<br>
					What also differs are our perspectives.<br>
					And as a result of that, our objectives.<br>
					<br>
					Our stories only seem to run separately,<br>
					in fact, many elements form a complexity.<br>
					<br>
					All these stories together form an entity.<br>
					In which you play a role as an identity.<br>
					<br>
					So we all add more colors to the whole.<br>
					And each individual thereby plays its role.<br><br>
