					<br>
					Recognize all the illusionary fears.<br>
					Even if it'll cost you several tears.<br>
					<br>
					The valley of fears you must now leave!<br>
					Thereby you'll discard an outer sleeve.<br>
					<br>
					Just as the butterfly will suddenly awake.<br>
					Is it the futile mind that you'll shake.<br>
					<br>
					The awakening will take place in its own time.<br>
					And the sacred outcome will be truly prime!<br><br>

					You have to open your inner eye,<br>

					The old goes and the new comes.<br>

					Everyone will witness the shift!<br>
					It'll be the most cherished gift!<br><br>

					I tell once more about chlorine dioxide.<br>
					It's the best miracle cure I've ever tried.<br>
					<br>
					By propaganda of lies they try to denigrate it.<br>
					But in public they do not want to debate it.<br>
					<br>
					They always make a big scandal out of it.<br>
					And convince only those who anyway doubted it.<br>
					<br>
					They compare it with caustic toxin and bleach.<br>
					And claim it would be bad what you could reach.<br>
					<br>
					But no one ever tried it - out of sheer fear.<br>
					They believe what the news says is totally clear.<br>
					<br>
					Imagine a remedy that cures almost anything.<br>
					And without cost, it's health that it'll bring.<br>

					<b style="visibility: hidden;">The miracle drug of choice</b><br><br>
					
					Would big pharma support something like that?<br>
					Or would they demonize it like a black cat?<br>
					<br>
					Who buys advertising in the normal medias?<br>
					And do they fake nowadays encyclopedias?<br>
					<br>
					Whoever exposes the lies will find salvation.<br>
					And he will experience a health sensation.<br>
					<br>
					Used correctly, you think you're in wonderland.<br>
					Because health and sanity walk by your hand.<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">The day everything changed</b><br><br>
					
					It became a special day for everyone.<br>
					For on this day the good really won.<br>
					<br>
					Colorful papers with which they lured.<br>
					Thus, the evil rule was long secured.<br>
					<br>
					When virtual numbers lost their appeal,<br>
					and all people recognized what was real.<br>
					<br>
					When no one could be influenced anymore,<br>
					when no one sold himself like a whore.<br>
					<br>
					At that time, everything suddenly changed.<br>
					And everything was spiritually rearranged.<br>
					<br>
					The morphogenetic field transmitted the data.<br>
					The consciousness became wiser and greater.<br>

					<b style="visibility: hidden;">The day everything changed</b><br><br>
					
					No one went to war to kill others anymore.<br>
					Everyone recognized in the other a holy core.<br>
					<br>
					All diseases were cured by all together.<br>
					As a result, everyone became clever.<br>
					<br>
					After all, money no longer played a role.<br>
					Thus we realized a long forbidden goal.<br>
					<br>
					We all worked together on our well-being.<br>
					And we realized our unity as the All-Seeing.<br><br>
