					In the beginning, you're led down the wrong ways.<br>
					And you're taught that it's mammon you must chase.<br>
					<br>
					But in the course of your life you may realize.<br>
					That the truth on the outside is full of lies.<br>
					<br>
					Some will never see through the deception.<br>
					Because they're blinded in their perception.<br>
					<br>
					But whoever seeks the redeeming will find.<br>
					For he who wants to see will not remain blind.<br>
					<br>
					That which is cryptic becomes soon apparent.<br>
					For that which was opaque becomes transparent.<br>

					And so the long search will come to an end.<br>
					And that which once fell will again ascend.<br><br>

					It's not the only thing that connects us.<br>

					But one secret is the humidity of the air,<br>

					<br>
					For the most part, you are made of water.<br>
					To be precise, three parts of a quarter.<br>
					<br>
					A portion of air is also inside the ocean.<br>
					All that water is constantly in motion.<br>

					So no matter if you are poor or wealthy,<br>

					And no matter if you are big or small.<br>

					<b style="visibility: hidden;">My own property?</b><br><br>

					When in Monopoly all streets are sold.<br>
					And worthless numbers replaced all gold.<br>
					<br>
					From then on, everyone should realize,<br>
					that in this system he won't win a prize.<br>
					<br>
					One must begin to question everything.<br>
					Even whether he needs an outer king.<br>
					<br>
					And the game must then be completed.<br>
					For otherwise sorrow will be repeated.<br>
					<br>
					This is how the journey leads inside.<br>
					Where you can discover all your pride.<br>
					<br>
					Everything you need you will manifest.<br>
					And what happened so far was only a test.<br><br>
