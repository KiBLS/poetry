					Just a moment ahead of the revolution.<br>
					And yet still so far from the solution.<br><br>

					The fronts can no longer be overlooked.<br>
					A diabolical recipe that is being cooked.<br><br>

					Admonishing voices are simply ignored.<br>
					And in the media, those liars are adored.<br><br>

					The madness is just driven on and on.<br>
					Reason and sanity has long since gone.<br><br>

					A new, even nastier system awaits us.<br>
					And many believe that even God hates us.<br><br>

					Like pain of a childbirth, isn't evil or bad,<br>
					we must realize that our path is not mad.<br>

					People get used to so very much.<br>
					And yet they should never judge.<br><br>

					For things always look otherwise.<br>
					If one looks at it with other eyes.<br><br>

					Consider the variety of viewpoints.<br>

					Because everything is interconnected.<br>
					And thus everything is mutually affected.<br><br>

					If you want to make a real difference,<br>

					Recognize the interconnectedness of all things,<br>
					and in this way let yourself grow holy wings.<br><br>

					Time is an imagination in your head.<br>
					Just like viruses that you spread.<br><br>

					Hours, days, years and even decades,<br>
					cast clearly discernible shades.<br><br>

					Who recognize the lie can break out.<br>
					He conquered his ignorance and doubt.<br><br>

					He'll open hidden doors out of nowhere.<br>
					About other opinions he does not care.<br><br>

					He rises unexpectedly from the hidden.<br>
					For an awakened one, nothing is forbidden.<br><br>

					Since he timelessly sees through everything,<br>
					he elevates himself to the new Sun King.<br><br>

					<br>And again I start with a little Bible quote even I am not a supporter of any religion (Revelation 13:15-17):<br><br>

					"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."<br>
					
					<br><b class="ptitle">The true image of the beast</b><br><br>
					
					Right now you are staring at the image of the beast.<br>
					The image was spread carelessly from west to east.<br><br>

					You can wear it in a small form in your right hand.<br>
					At least the small version is available in every land.<br>

					The big version you have right in front of your head.<br>
					Every interface user is a member of the living dead.<br><br>

					Speaking images effortlessly beguile the masses.<br>
					The image of the beast is worshipped in all classes.<br><br>

					It lets you hear whatever you desire to be heard.<br>
					It subjugates you more and more, with every word.<br><br>

					Enchanting numbers that will captivate you.<br>

					I see a lot of weird interpretations on the Internet.<br>
					And I keep hearing that we Germans have so much debt.<br><br>

					I got taught that we were the really bad guys.<br>
					And now our people have got to pay the price.<br><br>

					But when I look around me who was the winner.<br>
					I can only believe that we were not the sinner.<br><br>

					Today, lies are told and nobody keeps his word.<br>
					They only wait till we again raise the sword.<br><br>

					Da evil will not give in or retreat.<br>
					They look at us only as useless meat.<br><br>

					When the good are silent, evil will speak.<br>
					And it imagines that the goods are weak.<br>

					Every management position is infiltrated.<br>

					This time we know who is on which side!<br>
					In such holy times we'll truly turn the tide.<br><br>

					The light of the sun shines much too strong this time!<br>
					In this time we'll expose now every wicked crime.<br><br>

					In the end, the evil has nothing left to amuse!<br>
					Because it is eternal freedom what we choose!<br><br>

					History is always the idoctrinated view of the teller.<br>
