					Again, a military build-up is taking place.<br>
					For peace, however, it was a futile chase.<br><br>

					Again, ready to slaughter for the authority.<br>
					Regardless of the opinion of the majority.<br><br>

					Killing in the name of the great reset.<br>
					With the outcome of innumerable dead.<br><br>

					There would be so many reasonable souls.<br>
					But the money-rulers pursue other goals.<br><br>

					Someone sensible wouldn't want to rule others.<br>
					Rather, he would treat them as equal brothers.<br><br>

					But madness rules through money and fear.<br>
					Although the solution is so close and clear.<br><br>

					Self-responsibility, self-reliant, independent.<br>
					These are characteristics that shine resplendent.<br><br>

					All the old things are breaking down,<br>
					while new things are not yet tangible.<br>
					The current rulers lose their crown.<br>
					Thus something new can grow and is expandable.<br><br>

					Mystical and mysterious in the past.<br>
					Not understandable to the masses.<br>
					But these times have now passed.<br>
					For light falls in spite of sun glasses.<br><br>

					It dazzles people, because it is so bright.<br>
					For a long time it was extremely darkened.<br>
					But now it shines again the most divine light.<br>
					And thus, that which is, has been hardened.<br><br>

					No religion is stronger than the truth.<br>
					No lie is more powerful than the true.<br>
					It draws its circles first among the youth.<br>
					Everything begins with a renewed view.<br><br>

					The own perception is formed thereby anew.<br>

					Whether it is confident or full of doubt.<br><br>

					With the word the contradiction is created!<br>
					And these contradictions are then debated.<br><br>

					With every word, there is further division.<br>
					This does not require a conscious decision.<br><br>

					Language can heal but it can also destroy.<br>
					It can cause suffering but also a lot of joy.<br><br>

					Consider what you are using your words for.<br>
					And don't sell your creativity like a whore.<br><br>

					Use all your words wisely and intelligently.<br>
					This is how your language becomes elegantly.<br><br>

					Ignorance and oblivion is the true blasphemy.<br>

					They mentally cling to old and phony scriptures.<br>

					Always listening only to external preachers?<br>

					By blind faith, everything alien is demonized.<br><br>

					How could such blind faith ever be healed?<br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Transitions of eternity</b><br><br>
					
					Some came to leave, others to stay.<br>
					Some came to find their own way.<br><br>

					Some came to see, some came to do.<br>
					Some came to bring something new.<br><br>

					So many have come and gone already.<br>
					But only this eternal moment is steady.<br><br>

					It appears in a form of eternal transition.<br>
					And yet stays always in the same position.<br><br>

					Our awareness alone can perceive it.<br>
					Some do not suspect it and some believe it.<br><br>

					Many know, and even more are aware.<br>
					It is wisdom that exudes an unique flair.<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Money, greed and sorrow</b><br><br>
					
					One lives comfortably at someone else's expense.<br>
					Without restraints, one takes even the last cents.<br><br>

					That's how one shows one's mendacious success.<br>
					And denies his subordinates the same monetary access.<br><br>

					The whole society is mendacious and fornicating.<br>
					And for the oppression they expect a good rating.<br><br>

					How hypocritical can you get with this delusion?<br>
					One's own prosperity and success - pure illusion!<br><br>

					For enough imagined values and illusionary power,<br>
					they would even sacrifice their last remaining hour.<br><br>

					An unimaginable pitiful downfall is what I can see.<br>
					Oh, how all this lying and hypocrisy disgusts me.<br><br>

					The change will cost bitter tears and despair.<br>
					What waits on the horizon is a hellish affair.<br><br>

					But the vultures have to go through this pain.<br>
					Because if not, all their suffering was in vain.<br><br>

					Just like a little child gets burned by a flame.<br>
					In retrospect, one becomes aware of the game.<br><br>
