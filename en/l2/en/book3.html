					One should work every hour,<br>
					do not notice how the roses smell.<br>
					<br>
					After all, time is expensive money,<br>
					that's why the whole world is spinning today.<br>
					<br>
					But when you stop your time just a moment.<br>
					Every flower attracts you in its spell.<br>
					<br>
					The minutes and the hours do not matter.<br>
					Anytime you can choose them!<br>
					<br>
					Watch the wonderful nature.<br>
					Blooms for you the pure life.<br>
					<br>
					Give mother nature just a kiss,<br>
					and a stressful life becomes a pleasure!<br><br>

					The Grim Reaper is facing me.<br>
					I feel; he wants to come over to me.<br>
					<br>
					Has my time come yet?<br>
					Everything seems so blurry!<br>
					<br>
					My strength and energy; they are dwindling.<br>
					I am still looking for something, I have to find it!<br>
					<br>
					Minutes, hours, days; completely the same.<br>
					The time she runs by so fast.<br>
					<br>
					The hope; it disappears.<br>
					In the end, does Grim Reaper win?<br>
					<br>
					After a long time my fears disappear.<br>
					The journey begins, it is not the last, but the longest!<br><br>

					Everything's about the money!<br>
					After that the half world will jump!<br>
					<br>
					It is the one power that moves everyone!<br>
					No matter on which side it strikes out!<br>
					<br>
					Whether on the dark or light side,<br>
					opponents will seek the distance in front of the Force!<br>
					<br>
					Opposites burn victims like in a storm,<br>
					They' re gonna get kicked like a worm.<br>
					<br>
					But the change is already standing at the gate!<br>
					Listen only to your inner "tender words"!<br>

					The journey here has not been in vain!<br>
					Soon a big man will take the little broom!<br>
					<br>
					He sweeps away all the trash at once!<br>
					It becomes then clean where before was only dirt!<br><br>

					<br><b class="ptitle">Judicial Grace</b><br><br>
					
					A lot of applications and also fines,<br>
					Wait for you in the German harbour.<br>
					<br>
					There are complicated writings everywhere,<br>
					Totalitarian states drift on the precipice.<br>
					<br>
					Sometimes one is acquitted too,<br>
					but this is not always a custom!<br>
					<br>
					You are wondering what it depends on now?<br>
					Judicial grace - truly disgusting!<br>
					<br>
					Do you not face up to your accusation?<br>
					then you' re putting your life on the scale.<br>
					<br>
					But truly weighing is not what is done here!<br>
					Negotiations take place on the market and in court!<br><br>

					Am I a conspiracy theoretician,<br>
					or in the end a truth preacher?<br>
					<br>
					Is the whole world that sick?<br>
					Are doctors putting money in a safe?<br>
					<br>
					Is the whole world blinded?<br>
					Is every day property seized?<br>
					<br>
					Is the world completely disinformed?<br>
					Is the truth now oriented around lies?<br>
					<br>
					Truth or lie, many do can' t see it,<br>
					the good always shines in the same light!<br><br>
