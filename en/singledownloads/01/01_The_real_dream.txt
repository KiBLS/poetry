The "real dream"

I want to live all my dreams!
I want to take and give.

It's a wise and mature spirit,
which shows me the way towards purpose.

You just have to feel open.
And dig deeper inside of you!

Do not do anything while you have concerns,
fate will give you luck.

In the end, the brightest light appears.
Some see it, but many don't.
