The butterfly in the wind

I open my eyes but I do not see anything.
Everything is so dark, not a hint of a light!

I strive myself, with all courage.
What am I doing here - is it doing well to me?

Suddenly I fall down and glide off elegantly,
Above me, I see now a magnificent cocoon.

I only feel joyfulness and happiness.
Glorious perfection, piece by piece.

My beauty radiates like thousand suns,
because my new journey has begun!
