Like all flowers

Like all blooming flowers in spring,
I also like to flourish at this time.

But this year I will bloom more.
I will unfold my whole splendor.

And send all the other flowers in the shadows.
Because I am one of the most beautiful flowers of all.

I am a white rose in a field of mixed flowers.
Now, I have finally grow large enough to surpass all.

So everyone can admire my thriving beauty...
