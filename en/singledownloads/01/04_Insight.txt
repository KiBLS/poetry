Insight

Honesty and love bring you true happiness,
Did you understand it, there is no way back!

You create the true world inside of you,
there is the real wealth and also all the money.

The truth will follow you from now on, everytime
It guides you, from high-ups from the clouds.

All evil will face this force,
and in the end, get shattered in full glory.
