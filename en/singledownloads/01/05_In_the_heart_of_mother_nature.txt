In the heart of mother nature

I walk to a beautiful blue lake.
The ground below me is covered with green clover.
And take a look over there in the small clearing,
there grows a 4-leaved clover, such a rare sighting.

Now I lie fully relaxed beside this calm lake,
nothing hurts my excited spirit now any longer.
I am lying still and I am thinking
I ponder and directing.

Around me, I watch at the beauty of nature,
It affects my tender soul - just like a cure.
Nothing can stress me at this moment any more.
Everything that once was so important is now like forgotten.
