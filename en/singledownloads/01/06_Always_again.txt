Always again

A new day, he is born.
The last one, I have lost now.
In the beginning he is full of hope and so wonderful.
Until he's whispering to me; today, it will not be so great.

And immediately I'm worried again.
What shall I do now, what shall I do tomorrow?
I thought it would become easier with time,
and I would be ready some day too.

But again and again I drive in this circle of misfortune.
With every new circle my face is coloring chalky.
No savior, no help from my point of view,
does this mean a way out do not exist?

Now rise your dull look upwards,
and for all your misfortunes let yourself be praised.
Not one repetition was in vain,
because it is "the journey" of your life!
