Young souls...

Young in spirit, mature in body.
The behavior, it is still stiff.

Unreasonable and also stubborn,
it's going through a tough cure.

Grief and suffering,
make it ready for luck.

Learning more and more.
Loads the head like a gun.

In the end, stands a mature spirit,
which shows you your purpose.
