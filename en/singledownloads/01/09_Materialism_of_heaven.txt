Materialism of heaven

After many years I am finally ready.
I feel; my time is coming now.
Nothing can hold me here any longer,
nothing will split my mind again.

I want to go up, and right far beyond.
Break boundaries, get out of the house.
My fears, they are gone a long time ago,
They have gone to a distant place.

Now all power can awake in me
now i can finally laugh into the face of evil!
Because God's love is what me leads now,
and in the end also chooses me as the victor.
