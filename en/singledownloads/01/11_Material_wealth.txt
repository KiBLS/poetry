Material wealth

I couldâ€¦

... eat and drink as much as I want every day.
... carefree and enjoy my life in peace.
... buy me the most beautiful and expensive things.
... communicate with the most sublime and noble people in the world.

But it is always good ...

... to be sated and not to know about hunger?
... just to feel happiness and not to know about pain?
... to have everything you want and not to know about wishes?
... only to see the success and not to know about poverty?

Only he becomes good who knows both and calls all truth without lies!
