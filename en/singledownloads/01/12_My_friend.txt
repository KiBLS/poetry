My friend

Only with one in a lifetime I would build shit.
Only to this one I would entrust everything!

This person means so much to me,
because we're not just pursuing "one" shared target.

No power in the world can ever divide us,
now and for all times.

Here and now, forever and for all time,
I swear if you need me, I'm ready!
