The way

The road is dark and uneven,
but I feel a pleasant warmth.
I feel the warmth of a light from afar.
I follow this warmth, I follow her far beyond...

And so I wandered on and on,
continue on a path without a target
seems to have no other target than the light.
Where will lead me this light?

It shows me a brightly lit corner
and invites me to stay.
It's nice here! I feel comfortable here.
The light is warm and gives life.

But curiosity is driving me on.
Continue to the next bright corner.
The road leads again through the darkness.
I feel only the warmth of the light...

The next corner is much nicer than the last.
But the darkness was much deeper than before.

My curiosity keeps me going.
On and on. I am exploring beautiful corners.
I stay at many for a while
and rejoice in them.

I will now continue slowly.
But the illuminated corners become less.
And the road is getting darker and longer.
The warmth of the light is becoming weaker.

Have I lost my way? It is so gloomy.
Am I wrong here? Should I repent?
Back there were so beautiful corners,
I distinctly remember them all!

And yet I walked on and on.
Hoping to find the most beautiful corner shortly,
I'm driven slowly.

Hoping not be long
to dwell in the dark,
I let myself be guided.

Forward to the light.
Forward to my destination.
