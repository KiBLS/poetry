Carousel of Madness

Everything familiar repeats itself.
Old things are just new polarized.

Just a few see the big lie.
Even less understand it.

Right acting is still difficult.
Because many do not remember anymore.

But the time of cognition is approaching.
Everyone helps the other on his path.

Until all ways intersect again,
and together we avoid all dark paths.

You do not need much to understand.
It is one humanity and one destination!
