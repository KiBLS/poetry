The loneliness in the communality

Today we are leaving together,
It goes in the direction of heaven, up and up.

A retreat has long been out of the question,
because we are no longer the "master of the situation"!

Together we face the world,
She wants to bring us down, back to the old life.

None of our old rules will apply,
because I know now the most beautiful of all worlds!
