Roulette of life

You are in me and I am in you!
And just together we create the "here".

Everything together results in the whole,
It ripens and thrives, from seed to plant.

Like a young bird just as born recently,
and now hovering the first time in direction Earth.

It's also like a big game
if you risk something, you win a lot!
