I'll be waiting!

Together we hike on many paths,
towards true happiness and enlightenment.
Without seeing the goal in front of our eyes,
we'll try to comprehend it.

Just surrender to this strong compulsion,
and wander along the path with me.
Together we will discover the way,
Awakening true love in us together.

You feel well in my arms,
you forgive me for stealing your love.
In our hearts the same fire is burning.
Can you feel the flames? Are they at ease with you?

Don't be afraid, because we are not alone.
You are mine and I am yours eternally.
Don't leave me and show me loyalty,
that I will enjoy you my whole life.

And if we have accomplished it then,
the strongest power reveals itself to us.
