All Around Teaching

Last night I was in paradise.
I felt so good, not bad at all.
Then I saw a bright light,
I walked towards it, but I didn't touch it.

Suddenly everything was like in a beautiful dream,
I flew like a bird, from tree to tree.
Then I jumped leisurely from branch to branch,
cause I didn't feel any haste.

Dangers did not exist there,
and I always got back on my feet.
But I didn't think of a cat,
and finally jumped right in her face.
