The Phoenix rises up

He rises from the old ashes.
His wings are strong and broad,
His gaze is undimmed and sharp.
Imposingly he is rising into the air.

His beats blow away the old ash,
and make room for new.
His screams are blood curdling.
His will is unyielding.

He created new from the Old.
He sacrificed himself to the fire,
to once again to rise from his ashes.
He cleaned himself.

The knowledge and the truth are his vices.
He sees where other people do not see.
He feels, where other people do not feel.
He helps where other people do not help.

He reaches out for others again into the depths.
The heat and the flames do not bother him,
he burns again, suffers and dies...

Until the Phoenix rises again from its ashes,
in order to climb higher than ever before
only to fall more deeply than anyone else...
