Timeless tones

Words without love, without sound,
Stroked along my ear.

Meaningless, playful sounds,
preached to me of incredible beauty.

Nothing is the same as it used to be
or is still the way I once saw it.

Everything is changing, at every new time,
Do you understand it, you are finally ready!
