Everywhere lies!

Detecting a lie is difficult for the most people.
For they no longer know the truth of our world.

What is it, you are asking yourself right now.
Because without it, you are really bad.

It is close and yet so far away.
Unreachable like a bright star.

Can you see it?
Do you realize? It will never pass!

Can you feel it?
Are you aware? It will make you the winner!

Close your eyes and fill your spirit,
that way you will be closer to the truth!
