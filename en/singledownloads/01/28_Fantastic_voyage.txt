Fantastic voyage

Maturing spirit.
Flowering landscape.
Sun rays on my skin.

New but old.
Old yet new.

Infinity in transience.
Ephemeral infinity?

Enlighten me and give me love.
Illuminate me and grant me wisdom.

A new day is getting born.
The old died before its birth.

The transition is clear.
The transition is true!
