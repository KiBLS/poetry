Confused Ghost

Words which open doors.
Thoughts which move mountains.
Emotions which move worlds.

Is the impossible possible?
Is written with the beginning also a written end?
Is the end determined if there is a beginning?

Do I have the choice of a way in the beginning?
Do I have the choice of a path at the end?
Do I have the choice of a path?

Who is not aware of the beginning,
can not be aware of an end.
Where the path begins which ends Nowhere?

Lit a bright light , up there!
You can not even see, but it lights up.

Do you believe that this light is lit,
if you do not find it after a long search?
Perhaps you looked in the wrong places.

But every wrong place you discover,
brings you the bright light a little bit closer!
