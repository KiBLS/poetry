Freedom of thoughts

All my thoughts and my will are free now.
The compulsion and urge for success is now over.

There the last veil is also falling,
and reveals the true vultures.

Revenge, however, must not prevail.
It will divide the good hearts eternally.

They are still far too weak to unite.
The good is flowing down like a stream.

But who understands the true message,
is not walking anymore down the precipice.

He then wanders in a new light,
who knows the whole story.

Enlightened one would call it,
but only those who don't know it yet.

Everyone will see the truth very soon.
Because the evil will go away forever.
