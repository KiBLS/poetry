My new best friend

The warm rays of the sun wake me up.
My mother made me a delicious breakfast
But I'm in a hurry. I have to go!
I go straight out, determined along the road.

The birds chirp happily through the morning dew.
Many people are greeting me and they are smiling.
Everything glitters and shines. It is pleasantly warmed.
And yet I feel cool. Curious!

Now I have finally arrived.
At my best friend's.
Now I feel well after all.
and I enjoy the day too.

My friend has calmed me down and made me extremely happy!
The world is fine the way it is, everything is fine... Now!
I walk slowly homewards.
I have to rest. Rest for tomorrow.
Rest for the next time, because I am exhausted.

Exhausted from the change.
The quick change between happiness and pain.
The constant attendance of heaven and hell.
What if tomorrow the hell comes again?

I am afraid, but my friend says it is all right...
I just need some bucks to ensure I'm doing well
and he takes away my overwhelming pain.
and immediately transforms it into endless bliss for me.

But what if I can't raise any more money?
I am afraid of tomorrow because I have no more money....
What will my best friend do to me then?
Will I be strong enough again?
to get through the day? To endure the pain?

I hope so, but I hope also
that soon there will be no more tomorrow...
Only then will I be released. Released from the heroin...
My best friend on earth!
