Love awakens!

Can you feel her?
She is invincible and powerful.
Evolved she is flourishing magnificently.

Everyone can see her radiate.
Everyone will understand it soon.

No one has greater power.
No man keeps laughing at her.

Invincible, pure and true,
she presents everything that was once.

Everything what will happen,
Everyone can understand soon.

Only those who carry her inside their heart,
know how the true love is beating.

And when the end is imminent,
her power opens a new gate.
