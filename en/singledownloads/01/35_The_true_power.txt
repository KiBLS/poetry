The true power

My mind is now pure and clear.
As beautiful as it has not been for a long time.
It is powerful and strongly matured.
Almost unbending and stiff.

Only love fulfills him
And revealed to me the true meaning of life.
Love is the origin of everything,
with this knowledge, all power will be concentrated.

No one can destroy it,
and yet many will dare.
They will fail and be burned.
From the fire that's burning in my heart.

The power is so strong and pure.
It can only be God's love.
It is truly the greatest power,
which I have now unleashed.

People now remember the endless power,
which truly creates everything through God's love.
My message will spread widely,
and thus separate the good from the evil.
