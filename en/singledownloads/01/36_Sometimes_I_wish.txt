Sometimes I wish...

... I would be a leaf in the wind.
And haste from branch to branch.

... I would be a bird in the air,
and scatter my scent everywhere.

... I would be a rich man,
and go wherever I can.

... I would be a mature spirit,
who travels the world.

However, sometimes I wish ...

... I would be an idiot, and I would need
just my bread for living.
