In the spirit

Words that enchant.
Ideas that delight.
Feelings that seduce.

It is so clear and close.
Thoughts must travel.
Love must be free.

The eyes are closed.
I see many beautiful things.
A new world? An old world?

My body is a load.
The spirit is the truly I!
Separation is not godless.

Separate and connect.
Connect to separate you.
The only thing is the truth.

Everything is united,
Everything is separated
Only love knows the truth!
