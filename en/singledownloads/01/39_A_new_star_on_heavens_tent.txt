A new star on heaven's tent

You left us very early.
Many still can not believe it.

You went to another place.
Without saying goodbye ... just gone.

Your laughther and your charm,
made many hearts warm.

Blue eyes, blond hair ...
That was all a beautiful part of you.

Now you're gone... and we can not forget
that death has qualified you for maturity.

It's a tough job for everyone,
to understand why you left so early!
