Confused...

What comes when something else goes?
What's going on if something else is coming?

What passed when something new happens?
What happens when something new passed?

What ends when a target changes?
Will it change the end when the target ends?

Is a destination that has changed the end?
Is the end of a path to the target?

Is the target a reason for the way?
Is the way a reason for living?
Is life a reason for an end?
