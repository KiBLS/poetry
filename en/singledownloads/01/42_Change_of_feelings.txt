Change of feelings

I'm gonna open up to the big whole,
I don't wanna keep hiding.

I opened up and freed myself,
and had suffered a lot of misery.

The agonies were infinitely great,
but they drove me into God's bosom.

And fullfilled me with love,
so that everyone can see it.

Now I pledge an eternal awe,
and I remain faithful to my joyful heart.
