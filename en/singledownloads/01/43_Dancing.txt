Dancing...

I feel the rhythm,
I feel every bass vibrate.
My head is completely free,
All concerns are far away.

My body is in motion.
He dances rhythmically to the music.
A separation from the body begins,
a voyage of the mind through nothingness.

A moment filled with happiness.
A moment full of insight...
Then my spirit returns,
and the separation was accomplished.

Its reveals itself more and more;
The soul and the spirit,
They're not empty!
