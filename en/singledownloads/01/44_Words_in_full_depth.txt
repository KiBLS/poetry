Words in full depth...

A few words... They work miracles,
They're like tinder for my mind.

A few sentences... with beautiful words,
And my heart wants to hoard all love.

A poem... with such sentences,
Let me etch all evil.

Now I feel unlimited power,
the certain power that can handle anything.

She is permanently growing,
to soon break all axes.

Nothing can stop her then.
Because she will rule and reign forever.

And is my soul then purified,
so shall the true birth be soon!
