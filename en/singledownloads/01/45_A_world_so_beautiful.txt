A world so beautiful

The green meadow blossoms to new life.
The empty sky forms his artworks.
My spirit, it lives. My heart, it trembles.

Fresh buds are sprouting. New life is awakening.
White treasures adorn the view upwards.
I see a true splendour. I feel a great power.

The true mother and the father remain there.
They are so far away from here and yet not gone.
They lead us to a magical place.

Trust the guidance and follow the path.
Then you can look forward to true grace!
