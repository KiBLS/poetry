Paths of love

See over there. She wakes up.
She have slept and rested for a long time.

Now she is truly strong and pure,
so the evil end will be very soon.

Your power is shrinking more and more.
Your end is approaching, it helps us a lot.

We got all oppressed and driven,
have forgotten to love honestly and upright.

But humanity now understands
that the wind soon blows from somewhere else.
