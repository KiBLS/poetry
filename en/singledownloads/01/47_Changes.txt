Changes

My will will be served very soon.
It will happen to all of you.

It is strong and pure,
turned like water into wine.

He who knows the truth,
no longer runs to his doom.

Who marches with love,
It's tared from the inside.

Bend down or declare war.
May the better one triumph.

This will be the last battle.
It will be fought in the night.
