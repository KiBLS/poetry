Path of Truth

No one can follow the true path.
Everyone will avoid this tough path.

But if one is very old and wise.
Then one understands the meaning of the long journey.

However, many can follow the tracks.
Then they know about the rules of the game.

But only an enlightened one will choose the tough path.
Simple people only unnecessarily torture themselves.

He strides forward with his full heart.
So that everyone will be able to see it.

The love of God has awakened in him,
and laughs mischievously at all evil.
