A fork far from all understanding

Like a blossom-white cloud on the horizon that nobody notices...
... That's how many people live their time.

Like a firm branch at the tree nobody notices...
... That's how many people live their dreams.

Like a grain of sand in the desert that nobody perceives...
... So many people live their end.
