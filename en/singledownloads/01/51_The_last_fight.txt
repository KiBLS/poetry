The last fight

I'll fight to the bitter end,
I will bring you to the great change.

Behind me an army of 1000 men,
an army of angels, will attack the enemy.

Nothing will protect your system anymore,
it won't serve anybody anymore!

The last of all great battles,
will be fought in completely new costumes!
