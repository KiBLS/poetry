The chemistry of the sky

The sky was dark blue any times!
I still remember exactly!

Such a deep and fulfilling blue!
I still remember exactly!

White cloud pictures - a show!
I still remember exactly!

Birds everywhere and the air so mild!
I still remember exactly!

The time went by so fast so far.
Meanwhile, the whole sky is gray!

But I remember exactly!
