Change of the eras

Why do I do this and that?
Why am I acting this way and not otherwise?

Do I always have the free choice?
Or do I really have the agony each time?

To have an option or not,
grope in the dark or with light!

The way remains the same whether dark or bright!
A veil in front of the eye and still often garish!

I can be blind in the light,
and i can see in the dark!

A path without destination ...
All life just a game!

The story is now taking its course.
Humanity is finally waking up!
