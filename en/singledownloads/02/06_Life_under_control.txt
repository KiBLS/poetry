Life "under control"

The calm and the strength,
holds "that" which creates everything.

The big and the little,
it comes of its own!

From thought to request,
there are only a few steps.

First cold and poor,
then rich and warm.

In the rain change from up to down,
first full then scarce.

Once evil, once good,
Once king, once thief!
