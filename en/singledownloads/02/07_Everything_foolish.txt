Everything foolish?

Who feels the words and listen to the meaning,
is justly outraged by this world!

Selfish, deaf and also dumb,
the whole humanity is running around!

Finding the "perfect route",
truly can only "the blind"!

Like a tight rope dance on burning candles -
The path leads right into our hearts!

"One" will soon be clear to all!
Nothing stays as it was once!
