Confused frequencies

My being - so beset and glum.
A frequent wave is shifting my mind!

The control from the outside, so strong.
The own will - buried in the coffin.

It demands a fanatical majority;
total control - no freedoms!

All paths will intersect soon,
a large part will suffer because of this.

The "free compulsion", it becomes the norm.
"Forcing freedom" in a new form.
