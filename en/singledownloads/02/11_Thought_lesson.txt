Thought lesson

Open the eyes to see.
Stretch the legs to stand.

Red, yellow, green - totally the same,
poor thoughts - rich thoughts!

Awakening after endless teachings.
Awakening to finally fight back!

The daily life too colorful!
Therefore, many rested in the underground.

From a beginning to an end -
All thoughts - just a game!
