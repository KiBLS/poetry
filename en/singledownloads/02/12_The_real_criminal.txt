The real criminal

A gangster - Deep in the heart,
Deep inside of him is only pain.

The system - so full of contradictions.
Only a moment before the collapse.

The sinking - a clear view,
there is finally no return.

Money and power - a bad joke.
It only hurts the people.

A look inside of you will reveal it to you,
What is so wonderful about this delusion!
