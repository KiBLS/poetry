Money, money and money

Where to go with all my money?
How much does the whole world cost me?

I am in a material delusion.
My mind is beautifully tame.

All troubles and all frustrations,
everything gives in to this material pleasure.

I want to have everything I can!
And now - not sometime later!

But all the wealth and abundance -
usually only feels like another "shot"!
