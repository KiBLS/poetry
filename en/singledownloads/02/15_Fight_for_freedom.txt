Fight for freedom

I only see virtual pictures ...
And on all corners only signs!

Sitting in a noble cage.
Digitally scratching the days.

Will you recognize the grids soon?
and then the guards burn.

The whole humanity is subjugated.
But resistance is beating in all hearts.

The last revolution - so close,
The call of freedom - you hear it clearly!
