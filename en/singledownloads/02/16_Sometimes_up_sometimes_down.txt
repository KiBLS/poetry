Sometimes up, sometimes down

I ask myself; Who i really am.
I ask myself; after the true sense.

I feel power; and much more!
And yet I feel so often empty.

In a heavy stir change; cold and warm.
The pure harmony; wild and tame!

Yin and Yang; a minus and a plus.
Duality extreme; a real delectation!
