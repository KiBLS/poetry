Glorified self praise

I like to read my own words,
they are of a "special sort"!

Everything else comes only from the outside!
From there comes the biggest nonsense!

Just pay attention to your inner voice!
So she can swim in the flow above!

All the chaos is going to end anytime!
Do not forget, you are in the middle of "the change"!
