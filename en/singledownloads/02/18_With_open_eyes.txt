With open eyes

Just a little thought in another place.
It changes the entire structure immediately!

Just a little word in another spot.
It changes the whole purpose of content!

A lie instead of the truth
just brings heartache no clarity!

When you once see the pure truth,
you will no longer flee in the face of lies!
