The decisive force

You never had to confess yourself this way in the past.
To name all his friends and enemies too.

Make so final, quick conclusions,
because you do not want to lose.

But is it really "a battle"?
When the flame of the heart is kindled?

Nobody can stop this force then.
Restraining, tame or block it.

United power at the moment of the downfall!
The power of the heart - it creates everything now!
