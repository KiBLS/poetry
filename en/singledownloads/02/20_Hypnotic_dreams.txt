Hypnotic dreams

Walking in a trance through the whole life,
Just acting completely selfish.

Did man not see it for a long time?
There are beings who have been craving for a long time.

A rough blow - in the middle of the face.
The last day is now standing in the judgement court.

The crowd has already met their judgment.
It grants us all a new world.

The old go, the new come,
the big change - has now begun.
