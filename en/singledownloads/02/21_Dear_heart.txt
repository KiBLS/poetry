Dear heart

Words right from the deep of the heart!
Instantly melt away all pain!

Sentences directly from the deep of the heart!
Burns brighter than "all" candles!

Rhymes coming from the heart!
Include luck in every verse!

Poems - many words, phrases, rhymes!
Make love from the deep of the heart - appear!
