One unit

Do I act free or with compulsion?
Am I for Yin or for Yang?

Am I here or am I there?
Am I coming now or am I leaving?

Am I right or left?
Am I even up or down?

Good and bad, warm and cold -
only opposites in a guise.

The light shines into the darkness.
Everything shines as a single view!
