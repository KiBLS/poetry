A ray in the darkness

Deep inside of his heart,
there' s been a great pain for a long time.

Every evil and slanderous word,
continues this cycle.

Injured and smashed to the ground,
he will do what many do not dare;

He looks fearlessly into the"eyes of evil",
and thus he will rob him of all his power.

Full of new energy and confidence,
he stands up and speaks "of the light."
