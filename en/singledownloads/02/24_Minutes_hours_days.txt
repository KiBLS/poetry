Minutes, hours, days

In the process of evolution -
many have risen to "a throne."

They ruled the masses for a long time,
Divided them into classes and races.

This change has already begun!
We have nothing lost - only won!

The day of the last emblem -
The near end of this system!

The downfall in transition,
takes many years this time!
