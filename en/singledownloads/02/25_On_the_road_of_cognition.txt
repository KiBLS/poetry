On the road of cognition

At the expense of many little ones
who are crying over there on the ground.

Every single drop of bitter tears,
I will enjoy while i drink my cool beer.

I am so endlessly full of pure fortune,
Getting richer all the time - piece by piece!

At the expense of the many poor fools,
I always drive the newest cars!

This life is like a hypocritical paradise!
For me so beautiful - and only for other lousy?
