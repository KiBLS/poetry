Out of the flames

Beaten by the society.
At the nose and deep into the stomach.

Loser on the ground and groaning,
The winners are standing and scoffing.

Flames are fanned as high as meters...
The Phoenix is touched inside.

From the depths he is now rising,
"Up to the sky" everything in a single run!
