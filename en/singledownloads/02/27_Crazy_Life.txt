Crazy Life

You're often wondering about your life?
Wish to know more - just walking on a knife?

Open your eyes and see the true life,
It's you, it's me, it's man and it's wife.

Open your heart and feel all the life.
Wondering still about your own life?

Differents are becoming close,
Liars will become a dirty nose.

Everybody will see it soon,
Bad people earn a wooden spoon!
