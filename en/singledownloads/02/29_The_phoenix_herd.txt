The phoenix herd

I hereby call upon every poet;
come up with me towards heaven!

Let us literally travel with all people!
It is just a very small step!

The great burden - it will pass away,
it will soon turn into the opposite!

Then there is thrust from below!
Fire flows out of 1000 wounds!

One Phoenix alone, that's fine!
But only in the pride we really strike!
