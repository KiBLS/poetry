The real house

The heart isn't that easy to wake!
You have to put more work in it!

It is the core that you have found!
Briefly before you restart your rounds!

But to truly enliven it!
It will need a lot of trembling!

Do you also see divisions?
And smoke also everywhere?

A new house will be built!
Each human being will look after it!
