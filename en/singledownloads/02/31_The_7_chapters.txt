The 7 chapters

The noble messenger and the old race,
living in the middle of the blind crowd.

Stunned by poisons and dumb,
everyone's wandering around without a plan.

The opposites are now ablaze,
Flames are blazing - the phoenix is glad.

A fairy tale will be written!
The number of chapters - they are seven!

The first describes a "dark light"!
A signpost - only a new perspective!
