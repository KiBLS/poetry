The Dark Enlightenment

Did you see it too?
The deepest of all depths,
the darkest darkness,
the blackest black?

It seems like a dark light,
but it's brighter than a thousand suns!

A deeper, darker, pitch-blacker
and yet sparkling circle I saw,
that was absolutely EVERYTHING "what has been there"!

And "what has been there", that will last forever!
But " this moment " enters your heart!

In "this moment" all veils fall completely!
You can see the love, and you feel more free!
