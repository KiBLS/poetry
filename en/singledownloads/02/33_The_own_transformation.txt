The own transformation

Fear and doubts are leaving,
this will change the structure immediately!

A lie instead of the truth,
just brings sorrow no clarity!

Is it really true?
All the lies that I saw?

Is that right too?
Am "I" honestly important?

Knowledge comes out of insight,
Motivation comes out of love!
