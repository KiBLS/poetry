The First Prophecy

This is one of three!
After this it will prophecy itself!

Many short words together,
are going to confuse you!

Listen to these quiet, tender words!
They open a long forgotten gate!

In the light you can recognize them soon.
Dualities - they start to burn!

A battle with many dead!
An old race sends the messenger.

Selfless in the heat of the battle!
Good and evil - left and right!
