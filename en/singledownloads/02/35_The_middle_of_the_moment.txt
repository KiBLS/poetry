The middle of the moment

Is the moment already mature?
Thinking still seems too stiff!

Has the time already come?
I guess it started recently!

Can one ever be ready?
Very often I still feel alone!

But the itinerary is predetermined,
bright light glows at the end of it.

Only a few steps are left,
it leads me to my own center!
