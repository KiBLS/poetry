Prison of Thoughts

What should I do? Where should I go?
What is out there, what is in there?

I have no joy in what I do,
What just happened, what's next?

I am completely empty and unimaginative,
Was I once small and am I now big?

Depressed and gloomy,
is this what makes me happy?

Can I still turn "my leaf"?
Or should it really end like this?
