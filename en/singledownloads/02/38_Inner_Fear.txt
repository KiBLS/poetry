Inner Fear

The only thing you should not do is despair.
when doubts are gnawing inside of you!

Because if you would only complain all the time,
bad things happen to you again!

This I have not only from many legends!
Who promote this thesis and carry it!

Against this no one should dare to disobey!
Because nobody can fight this battle!
