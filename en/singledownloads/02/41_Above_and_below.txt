Above and below

What if my thoughts became words?
Would this change my speech?

What if my words became actions?
Would this affect my thoughts again?

What if my actions became "real"?
Would then my world change?

The "above" as well as the "below" it is both truth!
The lie and the truth - both clear as the sun!
