Similar Love

I'm looking into your brown eyes,
I know you're happy about - That's nice!

I'm looking deeper in your eyes,
I see a flame around with ice.

I am looking now at your lovley mouth,
I can see a smile - direct under your nose.

Now I close my eyes - and in my mind;
Only you and me... and thoughts are kind!
