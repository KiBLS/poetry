Time announcement

What else do you want to achieve?
Your army is composed of 1000 corpses!

We simply let this chaos end now!
The system is finished and we are seizing!

The great mass is now rising,
the whole earth trembles beneath her!

The revolution in the middle the evolution,
Experiencing this live - it is a real fascination!

A new age - it begins!
From now on everyone wins!
