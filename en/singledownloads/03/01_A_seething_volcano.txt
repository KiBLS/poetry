A seething volcano

Am I happy with my life?
Or is there a tremor deep inside of me?

To destroy everything old in me,
and summon a change?

It is a comprehensive transformation.
Lift me from below to a throne?

From deep down all the way up.
The change now take its course.

Like Phoenix out of the ashes.
Like ripening wine in a bottle.

It has been germinating in me for a long time,
to shine really bright in the end.

The real power, it grows up.
It closes every human in its spell.

And if the old has once passed.
The good will become an endless power.
