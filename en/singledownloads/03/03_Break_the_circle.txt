Break the circle

I say as usual: regretfully!
I've made another lap.

One lap after the next,
I just walk in circles.

It's not nice in this circle,
the body gasps and gets pretty hot.

No human recognizes the circle,
no one calls the agony by name.

The agony of survive, again and again.
every lap raze me down once more.

Clenched power burns inside of me,
which still accomplish many laps.

But more and more here in circles,
I'm getting old and yet not wise.

Until I break the circle of life,
Only then you recognize; nothing was ever in vain!
