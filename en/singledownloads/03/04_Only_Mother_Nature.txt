Only Mother Nature

One should work every hour,
do not notice how the roses smell.

After all, time is expensive money,
that's why the whole world is spinning today.

But when you stop your time just a moment.
Every flower attracts you in its spell.

The minutes and the hours do not matter.
Anytime you can choose them!

Watch the wonderful nature.
Blooms for you the pure life.

Give mother nature just a kiss,
and a stressful life becomes a pleasure!
