Clownish theater

Is everything just a holographic bogus?
Will become just a dream in the end?

The biggest clown keeps screaming loudly;
"give me quickly the next bride!"

We play pure puppet theater,
your role - she is exactly "here"!

Whether we dream or hallucinate,
Sweat, shiver or freeze.

It's just an abstract stage play
Experience bad luck or play with bliss!
