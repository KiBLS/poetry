From inside to outside

I am my own idol,
I feel so good inside!

I am full of contentment and happiness.
Experience it as an endless long piece.

Nobody needs to offer me something,
because I am satisfied inside.

I want to become like I already am!
Live this one moment in the middle of it.

The light falls into the darkness.
It ends the reign of the linear time.

When the last veil finally falls,
will it change the whole world!
