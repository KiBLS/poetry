Limited development?

The unrest rages deep inside of me,
the change stands in front of the door.

The direction - still obscure,
the beginning - was the other day.

Unnoticed, everything started.
But will it ends sometime?

The signs can still dazzle.
The situation will soon change.

The first time you realized the meaning,
like a grain in a heap of sand.

Infinite gets redefined,
Time centered in the middle.

The key fits in the lock,
like the rider on its steed.

Perfection in purity.
After the fission, unity grows.
