Off into the matrix

Here and now and without atonement,
we enter the big stage.

The aura is shining very bright.
This is the onliest way to rhyme honestly.

The chakras are harmonized,
only in this way the body works.

The energy field is balanced,
Time has just flew by so fast.

Harmony - truly difficult to master,
but finally found, she knows how to inspire you.

She rises like a phoenix,
with the poetry of a king.
