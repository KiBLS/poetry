Gossip factory

It is rumored so much.
Because the sun is darkened.

It is reported a lot.
Clouds are heavily condensed.

There is a lot of whispering.
Muttered over fine dust.

It is told a lot.
What torments people to be nasty.

It is written a lot,
If bad, it will be likely exaggerated.

Finding the truth is not easy.
Because freedom is achieved by it.
