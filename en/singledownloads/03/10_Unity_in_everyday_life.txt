Unity in everyday life

I do the same every day.
Feel myself thereby like a corpse.
Every day the same routine,
serving the Mammon - my God?

A whole life full of days,
the question arises for me;
What do the days have in mind?
The answer - is deep inside of me.

But I can not find it,
I have to toil myself every day.
Full with distractions and colorful mica,
I sit in my room in the evening.

The way out - is right under my nose.
In the development - only one phase.
In the infinite aspect of being.
Everything will become one.
