World theater

Whether noble banker or dubious dealer,
they are all the best - actors.

Everyone plays his own role perfectly,
Everyone is involved - into the biggest project.

Holography is truly fantastic;
in the right hand it acts - plastically.

Because behind the curtain everything is dark,
Such a deep black - with bright sparkle.

All entertainment is just for you!
All opposites - meet each other!
