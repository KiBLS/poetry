Oh, the love

Oh, you humans come and see!
You have twisted the whole world.

Oh, you humans come and marvel!
The whole world is in a bad mood.

Oh, you humans come and feel!
The whole world, emotionally cooled.

Oh, you humans just feel - it's time!
The whole world is crying for a change.

You just need to start sincerely loving!
Because love can not be defeated by any human!
