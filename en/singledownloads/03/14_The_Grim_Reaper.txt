The Grim Reaper

The Grim Reaper is facing me.
I feel; he wants to come over to me.

Has my time come yet?
Everything seems so blurry!

My strength and energy; they are dwindling.
I am still looking for something, I have to find it!

Minutes, hours, days; completely the same.
The time she runs by so fast.

The hope; it disappears.
In the end, does Grim Reaper win?

After a long time my fears disappear.
The journey begins, it is not the last, but the longest!
