Dual contradictions

Should I have a rest?
Or should I do something useful?
Leave everything as it is?
I can't put anything into words.

Deep within me there is - oppression...
Thereby so far away - happiness.
Good and bad thoughts,
let me waver within.

Look; life is like a game!
Everything together leads to the goal.
Whether good or bad,
whether it's wrong or right.

No moment was ever in vain,
it leads to the goal no matter where you come from.
All good and bad together,
ignites your own heart.

Something bad done,
that was well thought out in the beginning?
Something good done with your heart,
to experience bad things afterwards?

Many ways lead to " that point ",
there's a reason for everything!
The best thing to do is rejoice,
and never fear unknown paths.
