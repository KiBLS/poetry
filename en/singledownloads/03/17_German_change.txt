German change

All true poets and all thinkers,
They turn to a faithful leader!

This apathetic, german country,
needs again a powerful hand!

The constitutional state, it has served its time!
All duties were long splinted.

Democracy was a long term issue!
It only benefited the brazen so extremely!

The new way of ruling in this country!
Is now breaking the old shame again!

The German country was oppressed for a long time,
We were all very enchanted by these changes!

But the real change has been a long procedure!
What comes now is a real reparation!
