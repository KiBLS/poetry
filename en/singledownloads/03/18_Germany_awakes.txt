Germany awakes

I'm from ..., I was born here.
I realized that everything is conspired.

In every little corner - and in every town,
the bigger ones checkmate the smaller ones.

Suppress and destroy the potential,
like no one would ever judge it.

But the land of poets and thinkers is awakening!
If we do nothing, it would be ridiculous!

Now we take the control that we deserve!
We touched the lowest ground long enough!

All poets, thinkers and philosophers,
now rhyme for peace precious verses.

A triumph among the people means eternal peace!
We have already decided to do so for a long time!
