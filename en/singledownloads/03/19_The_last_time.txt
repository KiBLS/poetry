The last time

Will my writings one day be burned?
Well banished from the mindset?

The seed - it has long been spread.
No matter how much you hurry!

From the seedling grows a tree.
Nobody can control its growth!

Further and further towards the sun,
Dreams are becoming a blessing.

Is fantasy a part of reality?
Or is reality a part of fantasy?

One will understand the unity soon!
The truth will be seen very soon!
