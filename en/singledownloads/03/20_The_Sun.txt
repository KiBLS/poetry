The Sun

Every evening she goes down briefly.
Every morning she makes you smile.

Every day she shines down on us.
Every night her light is very scarce.

Every time I see her again,
I feel her warm closeness again.

She goes on another round,
She'll be bright again in the morning.

The sun often appears too bright to many people,
but only thanks to her it will be light again!
