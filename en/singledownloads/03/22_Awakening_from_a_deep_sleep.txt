Awakening from a deep sleep

The whole life is like a theater play!
Everyone plays his part, full of joy!

Now it is performed with all its vigour.
Peace that lasts forever is achieved by it!

The whole German country; deeply in twilight sleep,
but there are only a few rhymes needed!

These words are like tinder, they blaze fast!
Even the golden sun will soon shine brightly again!

The sky - it will soon be dark blue again!
Because the Germans - they are truly clever!

A German only will bring the great turning point!
And devour all evil with his light!
