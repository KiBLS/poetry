Foreign Words

Many lives have been yours.
You do not become wise on your own.

Truly you have passed the test,
Now find out all the rest!

It will be a very long journey!
The wisdom will be yours forever!

You can make yourself immortal now!
You only have to do something once more!

Pay attention to the cycle of the nature!
And enjoy your wisdom pure!
