Thoughts re-formation

Does the "sound" have any weight?
Can I feel basses on my face?

Is the "vibration" a mass?
Pressure points of various classes?

What weights green and what the light?
There is a new science in sight.

Weight, mass, meters and also degrees,
distract from the "universal path".

The mind is restructured,
Thoughts combined with each other.

The truth will be recognized!
The lie will then be banished!
