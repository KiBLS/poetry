Ruling Servantship

Oh my noble Lord, excuse me!
But are my thoughts still free?

Is the control becoming scarce?
If I have my very own opinion?

May I look directly into your eyes?
Or will you oppress me further?

Deep inside me rages a true hurricane!
The one who wants to end this madness forever!

But now I place myself above you,
it won't help the whole situation.

It can't be in the long run!
Eternally this master with his little minion!

So let us wake up together!
To laugh together about old times!

Because who ever wants to rule only,
he also has to constantly peal somebody!
