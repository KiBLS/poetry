Child of the sun

Every year presents its seasons,
let yourself be guided by them now!

Understanding what is written here can only;
Who gives me a faithful oath!

Are you now afraid of the beast?
Remember; there are four seasons!

Please dispel your unnecessary sorrows!
Then I will give you another morning!

The sun has been watching for you a long time!
She gives you a kiss on your cheek!
