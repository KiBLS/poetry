Verses of life

I dared so much in my life,
and thereby spoils my chances.

The whole life is only a false illusion,
I thought it would be more but it shouldn't be.

Will I play along in this depressing drama?
No matter what I did I never found - the true happiness.

But the courage it is growing from within!
Together with Him, you will achieve very high heights!

What the whole life is supposed to be you ask yourself now?
If you were almighty; what would you do?

Just use this one big opportunity!
Now finally get ready for your life!
