People of today

Many people are naive today,
because the time; it's relative.

Many people are confused today,
because the world doesn't belong to them.

Many people are on the floor today,
because their life has too many cycles.

Many people are at their end today,
because their way is full of foreignness.

But even today there are people,
which rejoices their whole life!

Because who will see the light once,
will be fully refreshed in all being.
