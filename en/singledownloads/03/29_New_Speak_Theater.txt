New Speak Theater

Rhyming in Newspeak - not easy at all.
Language censored - words recalibrated.

I slowly get a big hangover.
From this stupid new-speak theater.

Never write something incorrect.
Do not stick around old views.

Everything is banned and censored,
until the last stubborn head parries.

Because with less beautiful words,
it's easier to promote stupidity.

The great ideas - they will all go.
The next generation will see it approaching!

Newspeak will cut off all thoughts.
Philosophers must avoid so many words.

Humanity has a hard time grasping it!
So many people will speak in two classes.
