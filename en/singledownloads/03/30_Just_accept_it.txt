Just accept it!

I know what you're spending money on!
What you hate and what you love.

I know where you spend your free time!
What songs you are singing in the shower.

I know who you are talking to!
What kind of people you worship.

I know exactly what you like!
Whatever you complain about friends.

Protecting data? No hurry!
I know what you have searched for online!
