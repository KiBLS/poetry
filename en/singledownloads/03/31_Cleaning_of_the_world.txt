Cleaning of the world

Everything's about the money!
After that the half world will jump!

It is the one power that moves everyone!
No matter on which side it strikes out!

Whether on the dark or light side,
opponents will seek the distance in front of the Force!

Opposites burn victims like in a storm,
They' re gonna get kicked like a worm.

But the change is already standing at the gate!
Listen only to your inner "tender words"!

The journey here has not been in vain!
Soon a big man will take the little broom!

He sweeps away all the trash at once!
It becomes then clean where before was only dirt!
