Judicial Grace

A lot of applications and also fines,
Wait for you in the German harbour.

There are complicated writings everywhere,
Totalitarian states drift on the precipice.

Sometimes one is acquitted too,
but this is not always a custom!

You are wondering what it depends on now?
Judicial grace - truly disgusting!

Do you not face up to your accusation?
then you' re putting your life on the scale.

But truly weighing is not what is done here!
Negotiations take place on the market and in court!
