Conspiracy

Am I a conspiracy theoretician,
or in the end a truth preacher?

Is the whole world that sick?
Are doctors putting money in a safe?

Is the whole world blinded?
Is every day property seized?

Is the world completely disinformed?
Is the truth now oriented around lies?

Truth or lie, many do can' t see it,
the good always shines in the same light!
