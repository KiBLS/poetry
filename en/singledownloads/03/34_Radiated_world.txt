Radiated world

Radiation acts like a hard damper!
Let it go and turn into a fighter!

The world, it is now changing radically!
The world, she now overthrows the old system!

For many centuries suppressed,
The victory scarcely happened to anyone!

But now a new time is dawning!
Are you ready for this change?
