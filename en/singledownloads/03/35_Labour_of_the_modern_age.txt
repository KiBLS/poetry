Labour of the modern age

The greatest words of my life.
Do you feel it? A quake?

The last move in this chess,
the mass is moving and brightly awake.

The change is seeing the light,
the world only has it in sight.

from string became solid rope.
It was a really long birth.

What happens from now on,
all humanity sees.
