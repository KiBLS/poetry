Ode to minds

Thanks very much for all reminds!
To my subscribers here on minds!

Never thought I would get many votes,
for my personal poetry notes.

But you make it possible for me,
to spread my words to the world fairly.

I hope for many more great days,
not just for now, for always!

A new consciousness will awake,
the old one was just a fake.

Thanks again for your great support,
now let's go on with my words export.
