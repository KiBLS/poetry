Poetic support

Sorry, I'm just passing through!
And I am sorry that I wont stay too!

But I will leave you a vote!
I hope it helps your channel to promote!

And I will leave you this comment!
I hope you enjoy a great reading moment.

Free thoughts and free speech,
this is what we decided to teach!

Wisdom will march on our side as escort.
Thanks so much for your support!

Oh, and before I leave - by the way;
I wish you a great day!
