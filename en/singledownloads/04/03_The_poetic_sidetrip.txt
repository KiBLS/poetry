The poetic side-trip

I just want to say hello.
To my faithful fellow.

I wish you a beautiful day!
And success on your special way!

What could i write more?
What would you may asking for?

I hope this little gift,
will raise you like a lift.

These words are just for a few.
But the meaning is personal for you.
