Hidden attendance

And again I stop by for a moment.
And again I leave a little comment.

To protect the meaning - for a time.
I have masked the purpose - in a rhyme.

Cryptic poems appear nowadays as Hit.
Because only a few can decipher it.

I do not provide a large voting quantity,
but i hope i can provide a great quality.

The whole life becomes a pleasure.
When you find the hidden treasure.
