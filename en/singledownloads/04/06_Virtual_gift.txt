Virtual gift

A beautiful good morning to you!
This day will make everythig new!

I thought you love to be woken.
By sending you a token.

Today will become a great time!
I support it with this rhyme.

And now just open your eyes.
To perceive a big surprise.

Because then the hidden is revealed.
So every wound can be healed!

Colors should cover now the entire gray.
And on the canvas appears this new day.
