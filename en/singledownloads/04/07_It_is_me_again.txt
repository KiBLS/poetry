It's me again!

I just wanted to say Hi!
But I am just flying by.

There would be so much to tell.
But above all I hope you're well.

I love to watch your channel grow.
Even my last visit was a while ago.

Just feel deep inside you this stream!
And reality will create your dream!

This is a particularly grateful poem version.
Which shall accompany you on your excursion.
