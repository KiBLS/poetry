The way to the treasure

I want to speak only great words!
Start from the ground like the birds.

I want to speak only wise words!
The lost wisdom found in many hearts.

I want to speak only inspiring words!
Sharpening my mind like a holy sword.

I want to speak only divine words!
Filled with love that comes from the heart.

But no matter what I ever speak.
And even if my words sounds weak.

No matter what will be my share.
And how I spread them anywhere,

I'll always look up to them.
To be my wisest guide out there.
