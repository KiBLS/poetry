Lovely development

What if I give you my heart?
And all the stars from the sky.

What if I give you my soul?
And all the treasures from the sea.

What if I give you, my whole self?
To take the good and bad of me till the end.

Would you accept these gifts?
To share it with me as additional shifts?

Would you be there when I'll most need?
To make for me things true and complete?

When you're not with me I miss a part,
Because in my life you're the greatest art!

But no matter where you are,
My love is never far!
