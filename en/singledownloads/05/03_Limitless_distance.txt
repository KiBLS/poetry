Limitless distance

You seem so far
But you are so close.
You're next to me
You're in my prose.

When i close my eyes,
I can feel you!
When i stay quiet,
I can hear you!

In every star
In every thought,
In every dream
You come along.

No distance can divide us!
No force can subdue us!
No matter what I do,
I constantly think of you.

Whatever you may say
Whatever you may do,
You are with me forever
And I am bound to you.

In this world exist no distance
Which can end our wonderful dance.
Our terpsichorean art has begun
Turning everything soon into just One.
