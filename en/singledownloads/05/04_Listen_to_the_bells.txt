Listen to the bells

Can you hear them ringing?
Can you hear them singing?

High up in the mountains.
And deep inside the oceans.

Sound like operas created out of wonders.
Striking unforgettable like the thunder.

Announcing a new time.
And stanzas full with rhyme.

Listen carefully what they "speak".
You can find what you may seek.

While they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle.
All the stars begin to twinkle.
