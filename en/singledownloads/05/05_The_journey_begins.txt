The journey begins

Today I will follow my fate.
Today I will open the gate.

Equipped with everything necessary.
Nothing more here that could be scary.

I have to start my walk alone.
It leads me out of my comfort zone.

I will explore wonderful worlds,
Inspiring me to write beautiful words.

I'll bring out the best in me.
A strong foundation of how it shall be.

Day after day I'll walk toward light,
With all the heavens by my side.

And when I reach my goal,
All the parts will be a whole.
