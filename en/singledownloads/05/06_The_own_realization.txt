The own realization

Now my thoughts are free.
They are flying like a bee.

Thoughts of wisdom and of truth.
Thoughts of elderly and the youth.

Inside of me everything is united.
Inside of me I was never divided.

In hard times I didn't give up.
Divine light has raised me up.

Whatever I dream, I will create.
On thoughts of wisdom I relate.

So many thoughts are passing by.
Many make me feel like i could fly.

Just a last step and I stride trough the door.
To experience what I have always felt before.
