Lovely explosions

I scream "boom" and i begin!
this battle I will surely win!

Ready to fight with words,
ready to pull the mental swords.

The real power is now awaken!
The evil gets ready to be shaken!

The awareness is now limitless.
An old battle resume in a new dress.

The pure love flows with every word.
Lovely wisdom is now preferred!
