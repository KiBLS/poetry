Battle of the truth

Who could ever beat the truth?
Carried to the old by the youth.

The lie will defend itself,
hiding behind a shelf.

But is it really a glorious fight?
A little lie girl defeated by knight?

For a real battle there is no need!
Because the truth will never bleed!

The truth stands like a mountain.
But truth can also be used as fountain.
