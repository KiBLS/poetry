The bleeding lake

Wounds which never healed?
Wounds in the heart which are sealed?

Every seal is able to break!
Love just acts like a lake!

Throw stones in it as much as you like!
You will never find the final strike!

Should a heart be strong,
like a fundament build from concrete?

Or should it be like the lake?
Which does not bother what ever you will make.

Every impact fade in the waters.
Although everything stay inside its borders.
