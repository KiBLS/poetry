History becomes my-story

My heart shall open the gate!
I want to feel just great!

My consciousness shall rise!
I want to become finally wise!

My whole being shall connect!
I want to skill a great effect!

The biggest secret is still hidden!
But it is not longer guilt-ridden!

The downfall of the last veil,
opens just the view for a new tale.
