Whole secrets

I describe it as parable.
A mysterious miracle.

I experience it as one.
And yet I am lost and gone.

But I was never really here.
Will never come or disappear.

The reality finally dissolves.
And something new evolves.

Did this really take place?
This single moment full of grace?

It'll not remain as seeming!
Never started or stopped dreaming!

Everybody has ever won!
Everything was ever one!
