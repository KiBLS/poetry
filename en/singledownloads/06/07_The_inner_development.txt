The inner development

Every thought is united.
Every thought is delighted.

My mind is balanced.
My inner voice will be silenced.

Is it just bittersweet ironie?
Did I really find my harmony?

Now I am able to enjoy the show,
while my aura starts strong to glow.

The transformation undeniable.
The change comes as reliable!
