The iron will

I will follow just my dreams.
I will carry them to extremes.

Ideas in my mind get whirled!
Ideas have changed the world!

My thoughts become written words.
They learn to fly like the birds.

There is no limit in sight.
I will keep the direction tight.

No way back, no further stop!
I will reach the highest top!

Just up and towards the light.
I am finally ready to flight!
