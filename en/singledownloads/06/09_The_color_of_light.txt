The color of light

Something was written from old.
Including secrets never told.

Something became upheaved.
Energy bubbles now out of deep.

Out of the shadows into the light.
Changing colors from black to white.

Dark secrets are finally illuminated.
For this the whole humanity has awaited.

Love and wisdom entering the atmosphere.
And slowly the new vision becomes clear.
