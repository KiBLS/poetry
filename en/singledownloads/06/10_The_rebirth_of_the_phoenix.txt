The rebirth of the phoenix

Do you hear the flames crackle in the deep?
Seemed as anything rested there to sleep.

It has been quiet for such a long time.
In the deep something is reborn from sublime.

Phoenix - he has been often named.
For the day he rises, it is wisdom he has claimed.

There is nothing that could hold him longer.
Every failure makes him so much stronger!

Now the flames begin very high to blaze!
At this point in time - everything seems craze!

The phoenix now rises from the deepest ground,
to receive the melody of life when she starts to resound.
