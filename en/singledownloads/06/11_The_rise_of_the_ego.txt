The rise of the ego

I want to arise higher than a king.
I want to unhinge everything!

All words will be choosen wisely.
Wisdom is suddenly appealing nicely.

Energies from the deepest universe.
They pervades every created verse.

Words full of vitality and endless power.
They will increase now with every coming hour.

A journey upwards without a stop.
It leads me now right up to the top.
