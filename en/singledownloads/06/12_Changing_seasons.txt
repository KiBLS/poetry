Changing seasons

The white splendour blooms again.
The autumn elapsed without complain.

The summer has a long time passed.
The spring will soon create a recast.

Every season has its own meaning.
Every season works on a cleaning.

Just observe the amazing cycle of nature.
And discover the greatest portraiture.
