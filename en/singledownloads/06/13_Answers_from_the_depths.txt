Answers from the depths

Or; "creative power of thoughts" part two?
Well, just let me continue!

I don't see any problems.
Because I am the solution!

I don't realize any chaos.
Because I am order!

I don't feel separation.
Because I am connected!

I don't accept any restriction.
Because I am boundless!

I don't ask any questions.
Because I am the answer!
