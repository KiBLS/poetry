The predetermined itinerary

In my gaze; there is only one direction.
I am on my personal way to perfection.

Growing faster piece by piece.
To reach the ultimate increase.

Consciousness on a entirely new level.
Far away from every old devil.

Old frontiers are finally crossed.
I am just winning, have nothing ever lost!

A new area is blooming in my mind.
In my gaze; the old fades far behind.
