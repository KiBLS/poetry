The big picture

You know the deepest ground.
You experienced it round by round.

So many voluntary sufferings.
Along with the greatest discoverings.

Each round revealed new differences.
Each round brought new experiences.

A binding that separates and
a separation that binds.

Without pain and without slaughter.
A drop just blends inside the water.

The whole picture will appear,
when you beat your deepest fear!
