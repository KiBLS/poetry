Moving words

Which words can change a society?
Which words can change it silently?

Thoughts become formed to written verses.
Thoughts are witnesses of all universes.

These words shall bring a change!
Diversification of another range!

Piece by piece to an epiphany kick!
Soon there will be revealed the greatest trick!

What could be a better choice?
Than just to follow the inner voice?
