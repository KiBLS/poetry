The chess battle

The white king appears on the chessboard.
He must win or lose - to receive an award.

His aura starts blazing high, can you see?
His appearance is sublime, do you agree?

His queen will break through all the rows.
Opponents must lose, this is all she knows.

Just forwards step by step and stone by stone.
Couple of figures must be ready to fight alone.

The queen now walks united with the knight,
to protect the king and ensure victory of white.
