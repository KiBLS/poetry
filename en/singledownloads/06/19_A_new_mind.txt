A new mind

Finally I am able to see after being blind.
Finally I will re-program my whole mind.

I am making a complete screening.
Every Verse receives its own meaning!

The last secrets get ultimately revealed.
And suddenly I appear on another field.

I realize everything as large nothingness.
And yet I realize nothingness as part of everything.
