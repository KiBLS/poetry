Ironic sarcasm?

For real; sarcasm can be great!
It is like a spell to a hidden gate.

When many parts form a whole - it becomes clear,
the whole picture suddenly appear!

I was never able to forget something before.
And yet I am able to remember so much more.

Everything old creates something new.
But did myself finally really grew?

I will dare the last important step,
to free myself from a legacy web.

Where irony and sarcasm starts.
I can realize one of the highest arts.
