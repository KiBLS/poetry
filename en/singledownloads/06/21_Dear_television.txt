Dear television

What has happened in the world lately?
Should i be totally upset or calm and sedately?

Tell me who should I hate today?
With who I am allowed to play?

What should I be afraid of this week?
About what fears I am allowed to speak?

And what should I buy tomorrow?
Where can I get some cash to borrow?

I'm so grateful for your great advice.
I can even book a flight to paradise.

All I have to do is make you my king.
And for that you promise me everything.
