Fantasy reality

I will break through every border!
I will create a totally new order!

Old burdens finally fall off from me.
New visions are born out of infinity.

Endless thoughts flow from my mind.
A strong support marches right behind.

Now I discern this special moment in eternity.
Love and wisdom will blend into modernity.

No more informations are withhold.
The new era manifesting inside the old.
