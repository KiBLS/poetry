The stone text

The foundation stone has already been laid.
There is no reason for a longer wait.

The journey leads me through many wonderlands.
Love and wisdom walks with me in both hands.

Now I can amuse myself about every shadow.
Some of them looks now beautiful for me somehow!

On the glade, a seed will sprout.
An old cricket starts then to shout.

Whatever will happen next.
Was written a long time in the "stone text".
