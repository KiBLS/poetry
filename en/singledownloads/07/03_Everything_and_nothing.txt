Everything and nothing

I'm talking about the real "nothing".
Some kind of noiseless rushing.

It is without any kind of sound.
And it will heal any inner wound.

It is neither deep nor flat.
It is neither thin nor fat.

And at all; it has totally no color,
and it doesn't even cost a dollar.

It will tear down all the walls.
And finally every curtain falls.

Now you can realize this single moment,
which eternally creates every component.

The great liberation of the mind.
The great mass will just be realigned.
