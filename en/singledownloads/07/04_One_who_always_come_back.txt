One who always come back

His greatest hour already rings.
He has seen coming and leaving kings.

His appearance is full sublime and noble.
His appearance is expected global.

Changing from black to white.
Changing dark to bright.

He will unite all contradictions.
He combines science with fictions.

He grows undeterred from seed to a tree.
Matured he will change the whole reality.
