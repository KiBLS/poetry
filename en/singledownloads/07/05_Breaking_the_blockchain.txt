Breaking the blockchain

Beeing perpetuated in the blockchain.
Not longer bound to a single domain.

Limited to a server in the past.
Boundless in the present and rather fast.

Censorship has no chance.
Freedom creates a new dance.

All the chains will hold at least.
Until the birth of an unholy beast.
