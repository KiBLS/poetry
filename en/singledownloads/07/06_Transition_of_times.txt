Transition of times

I don't think anything is impossible!
Because that would limit my thinking.

I don't think anything is unreachable!
Because that would limit my actions.

I don't think anything is untouchable.
Because that would limit my perception.

Every limitation will be overridden.
For a long time this was forbidden.

But now a new era has begun.
A new era full of joy and fun!
