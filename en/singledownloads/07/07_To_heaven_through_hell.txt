To heaven through hell

Prosperity grows, finally everyone becomes rich.
And then there will be an enormous switch.

Every wealthy man will realize his real poverty.
All old objectives will lose their priority.

A strange calm will reign before the storm.
Silence before every actor begins to perform.

It is close; the biggest inflation.
Followed by the great tribulation.

But even in such times of darkness.
Will many let their light shine regardless.

And when darkness get illuminated by light,
the paradise on earth will come in sight.
