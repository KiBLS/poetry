Endtime transition

The cannons are already loaded.
The sky still clear and unclouded.

The announced order to shoot falls.
It echoes through the heaven halls.

The thunder of fire is shaking the ground.
The whole earth can hear this sound.

Energies that collide with each others.
On this day brothers attack their brothers.

A big fight where everyone has an own opinion.
A great lie for which humanity acts as a minion.

The darkness finally dissolve inside the air.
Many lights ignite, you can see them everywhere!

This change will happen without a warning!
A flowing transition from the night to a new morning.
