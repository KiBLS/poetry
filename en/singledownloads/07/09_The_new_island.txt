The new island

A new island will be selected.
A new energy field will be connected.

Everything will get a new sense.
A united dream shows its presence.

Some will call it a new paradise,
others will know it as island of the wise.

For the whole humanity it is irresistible.
Full awakened we are not longer twistable.

The true philosophers of our time.
The strongest minds are full sublime.

This change has long been prophesied.
Long time awaited and now finally supplied.
