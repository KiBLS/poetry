Shadows of the past

In the future, people will remember.
A dark acting started in September.

The masquerade starts at the same time.
Corrupters disguised their own crime.

They betrayed each other; the own brothers.
One selfish deed followed now many others.

Lies were spreading fast and viral.
A never ending downward spiral.

A small coterie have the whole world effected.
But with other results than they expected.

All mankind suddenly awoke from sleep.
And finally they unmasked every black sheep.

Humans were simply connecting to the source.
And the futured history took its course.
