Era of the new kings

It's the poetry of a king again.
Written by a beggar with his pen.

The entire world is by this affected.
Because everything is connected!

The inner, ancient wisdom is activated.
The expansion of consciousness is celebrated.

Each verse contains infinite energy.
Unimaginable such an extreme efficiency.

Like an Emergency exit from a dead end.
No more dilapidated traditions to defend.

Thoughts of change are in transmission.
Meanwhile, each king takes his position.
