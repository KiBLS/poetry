Just a new beginning

Finding verses that no one has ever found.
Thus the inner life produces a new sound.

Old and useless programs are simply removed.
Potential that has slept is thereby improved.

For so long only a few had fun and played.
But now we're all changing to the next grade.

For this change only awareness is needed.
As a result, all expectations are exceeded.

Humanity soon awakens with loud cheers.
And finally the united consciousness appears.
