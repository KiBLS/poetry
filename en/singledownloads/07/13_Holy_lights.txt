Holy lights

We are the lights of tomorrow.
We will end the time of sorrow.

Masters who are awake and aware.
We let our light shine everywhere.

The darkness seeks the distance.
But light will break every resistance.

The darkness will experience a fright.
When earth will be bathed in light.

The change is soon in full swing.
Just listen when the earth starts to sing.
