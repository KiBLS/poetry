Emergency restore

Soon comes the end of suffering.
All the data is apartly buffering.

It'll be individual for each person.
First it feels like an internal arson.

The whole stage play is finally proved.
And every old programming is removed.

No one can withstand this final review.
Every fuse simply breaks through.

Every mind will be freed without a delay!
Many colors appear, where before was only gray.

It happens soon with a worldwide covering.
It begins the infamous era without any suffering.
