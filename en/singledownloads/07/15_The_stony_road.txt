The stony road

The new age is on the rise.
It's a true splendour for the eyes.

Ancient wisdom, its free for share.
And honesty which is ruling everywhere.

A common consciousness is growing.
Because together we are going.

Each one of us has already set off.
Each one have endured the scoff.

The way was not always simple.
Often we were blinded by any symbol.

But such experiences are a great guide.
The story is now changing worldwide.
