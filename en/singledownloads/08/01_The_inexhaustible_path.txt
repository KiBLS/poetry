The inexhaustible path

My path is one of the hardest and longest.
But my companions are only the strongest.

Hidden in the wisdom, many images appear.
The ether will spread them in my near.

I stay focused despite all the distractions.
I know they may provoke unsolicited reactions.

Decimating of a previous declaration.
Thus expanding the coming seperation.

My resolve and my courage will never end.
No matter how much from it I have to spend.
