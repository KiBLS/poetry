Roots which sprout

Now I can feel them growing!
Verses with a deeper knowing.

Many words are spinning in my mind.
Verses are harmoniously aligned.

Dreams I thought I'd never see.
They're presenting just a new reality.

The seeds of wisdom were planted and heared.
And imagine - many splendorous trees appeared.

My heart will no longer pretend,
like there are so many values to defend.

With a leap of faith, at the frontier,
Thus I've been saying farewell to every fear.

In the past I have only assented.
But today my dreams are finally presented.
