The inquiring answer

What would I do without my name?
Would I continue this game?

What would I do without my age?
Would I break out of this cage?

What would I do without my mind?
Would I take a single look behind?

What would I do without my heart?
Would I accept myself or break apart?

What would I do without my origins?
Would I still succumb to my sins?

Any answer you will find in you.
Any answer brings a fresh view.
