Evolving out of the chrysalis

Now i have some inspiration!
Am I really loyal to a certain nation?

Now i have some insights!
Do i really fight for human rights?

Now I have some informations!
Am I ready to dispel such fabrications?

The pattern is ready to appear!
Am I ready to act, now and here?

To speak truth I have been instructed,
regardless how big a lie was constructed.

I will dispel these crazy flurry of lies.
I will become one who really flies.
