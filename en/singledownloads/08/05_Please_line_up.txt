Please line up!

My voice marches on the front line,
grape juice became now noble wine.

I am protected by ancient wisdom.
Now I can act with love inside the system.

I am walking within nature's vibration.
All demons will lose their station.

All shrieks and horrors of my past fate.
Were transformed into recognition as of late.

I opened my battered hands with love,
And a warrior's grizzled face became tender as a dove.

Everything old will soon be reviewed.
Everything old will soon be renewed.
