Moving liquid data

The water vapor in the air.
Carries wisdom everywhere.

The time has come to learn,
Breath in.
Refresh the water in your skin..

Ancient knowledge powerful energy.
In the droplets upgrades are free.

The Higher mind outlines the truth..
Eyes are there to see the proof.

At the end our only goal
From many parts create a whole.
