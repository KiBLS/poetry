A new birth

My mind starts seeding.
New verses are breeding.

High vibrations, my mind starts humming.
Thoughts are formed and verses coming.

The rhymes are kicking in.
The words begin to sing.

Keep pushing it to find a limit.
Keep pushing it to enjoy every minute.

Nothing holds me back anymore.
I will find what I was looking for!
