We are one!

We are a single collective.
We are acting fast and effective.

No barrier is strong enough for us.
Past breakthroughs will be a futured plus.

All thoughts will be recoordinated.
Ancient requirements will be reformulated.

It's time for us to cross the lines.
And to realize the hidden signs.

Strap up, we'll all be along.
Together, we'll all become strong.

A great unity and a common intention.
We are truly the greatest invention!
