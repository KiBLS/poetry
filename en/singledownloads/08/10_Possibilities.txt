Possibilities

What could the love reach?
What could the wisdom teach?

A lonely heart stuck in a void,
pretending art with which we shall toy.

How far can these branches grow?
With a source that infinitely glow.

Do you see these reactions?
Between pointless distractions.

Dark clouds brush me.
Panic is surrounding me.

A never ending inner conflict,
With never ending lies and deceit.

But before I go to bed at night,
I can see that everything's alright.
