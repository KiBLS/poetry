Core exploration

Just explore your innermost core.
It is something you should adore.

Watch your thoughts when they flow!
Watch your mind so you too know.

Something isn't here and it never was.
Something has no reason and no cause.

Unrestored feelings seem to pass me by.
The clock ticks on and the time goes by.

The outside world is only full of lies.
Nowadays the truth is masked in disguise.

I will not accept such a demise!
Thus I will mature and become finally wise!
