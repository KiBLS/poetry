The great tuning

Now it starts to synchronize my mind.
Unusable data is just left behind.

My thoughts fly with the wind.
Nothing remains fixed or pinned.

All the stars are twinkling.
My mind is now kindling.

Just an interaction that you gave.
Because of that my mind became safe.

The whole universe sends a greeting.
To the point where all dreams are meeting.
