Please vaccinate me!

Can you give me an injection, please?
I just have fear, I don't have a real disease.

I don't care what it does or what it contains.
Heavy metals are anyway spread in all brains.

I am so grateful that it doesn't cost any money.
It feels like divine nectar, a liquid tasty honey.

But sadly my fear is not yet satisfied.
But maybe when the next injection is applied?

If you want, I'll invent a new fear for it, too.
I do not care how I get my favourite brew.

Ram that needle in real hard and deep.
That's how I send my fears finally to sleep.

At least then I am satisfied for a while...
Until again my fear triumphs over my smile.
