Flowing change

The day of change was foretold.
Long time whispered, it will unfold.

Wandering through the age of Aquarius.
A continued change, more glorious!

An ancient trust is again growing.
Change is a constantly flowing.

All the toxic beeings will be faced.
The earth will be finally embraced.

All stars are soon aligned.
For the great awakening of mankind.
