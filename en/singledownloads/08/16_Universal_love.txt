Universal love

What is real love I'm asking myself.
Dreams or illusions revealing itself?

Is my love really omnipresent?
Or do i only like a special element?

It cleanses the eye and washes the soul,
it makes once more a broken heart whole.

Real love is the fuel that regenerates itself.
Kindling the flame within a once hollow shell.

The real love bears all wisdom!
Real love never follows a special system!

With every single step she is doing.
Real love will create a neutral viewing.

Real love has no description or regulation.
It has a cross-border effect in every nation.
