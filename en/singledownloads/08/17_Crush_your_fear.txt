Crush your fear

Children with tears in their eyes.
It is time to stop the game of lies!

I speak for those who cannot speak!
I wake up those who still asleep.

Take a leaf from the book of existence.
Real love will overcome any distance.

I will act for those who cannot act.
I am just describing a simple fact.

Conflicts are just a game ruled by fear.
Just recognize the love in your near!

We are writing now many new fairy tales!
But this time we control all the details!
