Written law of nature

In the calmness lies the true power.
With this energy grows every flower.

True Victory arise without fighting.
Although everything seems often exciting.

The sunlight just warms the street.
Thus dandelion can break through concrete.

And when everything around is breaking down.
Meanwhile the dandelion simply creates its crown.

Nature has long dreamed of this new day.
And this dream now paves its own way.
