Just a new fiction

I know that everything is fiction.
Cause I found the contradiction.

You already know the truth we share.
Its just locked in your mind somewhere.

Far away from the path of destruction.
I have found the book of instruction.

Everything was right and I was inner prepared.
And finally all evil just seemed scared.

There would be so much I'd love to say.
Just devastate old programs on a creative way.

I assembled a new story from old shards.
A new general view was formed afterwards.

And as finally the fog cleared in my mind.
The truth I already knew was simply underlined.
