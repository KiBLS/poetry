Departure to the unknown

You know where the journey leads.
I'm just providing you some cheats.

It makes this stony road smoother.
It will simply act as life improver.

You do not need directions.
You know already all connections.

Let it work deep inside you.
Just let everything renew.

Harmful thoughts will simply vanish.
And no single mind will famish.

We're not going to ask when and how!
We're just going to leave right now!
