Sound of falling chains

The chains now breaking slowly.
They burst by something holy.

The light shines ever stronger.
These chains last not longer.

You can hear the call for freedom.
Just a foundation of a new kingdom.

The brightest light unleash;
as the frequencies increase.

The freedom calls ever clearer!
The era is getting nearer and nearer.

With a thundering crash they shall fall to the floor,
and mankind shall be enslaved nevermore.
