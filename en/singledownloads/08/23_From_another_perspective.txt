From another perspective

I am everything but perfect!
Honestly; I love to speak with a dialect.

I am everything but smart!
Honestly; I only think with my heart.

I am everything but a "grown boy"!
Honestly; I love to play for hours with a toy.

I am everything but a fighter!
Honestly; I only want the life a little lighter.

I am everything but a dream piece!
Honestly; I only want to be a messenger of peace.

I am everything but an ending!
Honestly, hope and love is what I'm sending!
