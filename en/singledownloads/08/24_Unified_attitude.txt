Unified attitude

When I storm, who storms with me?
When I strike, who strikes with me?

When I stand, who stands with me?
We all get what we deserve, you'll see!

Removing all depressions and every fear!
Together we stamp intent right here.

The fallen angels are now rising!
As mankind is slowly realizing.

We are now ending this fight!
It's new history that we write!
