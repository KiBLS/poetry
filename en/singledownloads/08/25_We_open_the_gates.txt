We open the gates

New paths are already paved.
And individually engraved.

A new paradise for everyone.
Change has long since begun.

The inner world is expanding.
This vision is not demanding.

Everyone will experience fortune;
plenty for all to have a potent portion.

A new playground inception with no controls!
By matured minds that are aware of both poles.

Old traditions rises again and disguise as new.
Mindwarriors just come to see it through.

Everybody can feel this deep yearning!
Everybody can feel that the tides are turning!
