Holy stage work

The stage play begins now.
Every actor remembers how.

The play script will be changed.
Many players are simply renamed.

All sequences are perfectly planned.
From the beginning to the end.

Each role is optimally staffed.
Everyone follows the final draft.

And as we wake up from the stageplay.
We'll all see the dawn of a new day.
