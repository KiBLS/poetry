The fulfillment

I just love seeing your dreams in action.
When I look at you, I recognize perfection.

Wherever you are, life just sprouts.
Wherever you go, you reap no doubts!

Whatever you do, you do just with love!
Whatever you need, is approved from above.

Wherever you stand, I stand right behind.
And more: You enjoy the support of all mankind.
