Nice to meet you!

I'm talking to you in person now!
I'll give you all the needed know-how!

We are at the forefront of the transition!
And we both will complete this sacred mission!

Altruistic thoughts are the ones that'll lead!
Our actions fullfill an ancient, prefigured deed.

We don't do it for money or fame!
We've just seen through the game!

We discern the endless melody of this new age.
We will now break out of our cage!
