Lights on!

True philosophy is approaching slowly.
True philosophy becomes soon holy.

It is rising from the bottom of the heart!
Presenting a new style neurolinguistic art.

In growth is the germinating starting power.
The seedling grows higher effortlessly every hour.

We will all meet in the daylight.
Together we'll now illuminate this night.
