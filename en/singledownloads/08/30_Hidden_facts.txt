Hidden facts

Often I can not realize the beauty.
Because I have to pay my duty.

Often I can not experience the love.
Because a Guillotine hangs above.

Often does the darkness blind,
because I have a human mind.

Sometimes I can see the light,
because I have the gift of sight.

Sometimes I can feel the love,
be it fist bump, kiss, or hug!

Sometimes I can see truly,
and realize all things have their beauty!
