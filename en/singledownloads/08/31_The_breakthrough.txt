The breakthrough

I'll blow up the core shell,
I'll spot the light spell.

The lighting became suddenly so bright.
I'm unable to ignore longer this beautiful light.

The boundless sky is the place I go.
With all my strength I'll now grow.

I will create a shared vision for the whole.
I am ready and dare to slip into my new role.

Nothing can stop my growth anymore!
A gigantic tree trunk grows now out of the floor.

I dreamed of endlessly beautiful trees.
And now I am finally able to feel this ease.
