Modern stone of the wise

Printing money without any price.
The modern stone of the wise.

Hotly coveted by everyone.
Who would renounce such fun?

Achievements through violence and misery.
A sadly fact that runs through history.

One repetition after the other,
a circle no one seems to bother.

The stone wanders from hand to hand,
and demands sacrifices all over the land.
