Particular change

You can smell the scent in the air.
The signs of change are everywhere.

Everything begins inside of you.
But what you find will not be new.

A brief glimpse at the first beginning.
Straightway all thoughts starts spinning.

The curtain falls, what surprise!
A great miracle in front of your eyes.

"Everything and nothing" is right there.
Now you can see it everywhere.
