Another morning

I hear bells that ring.
What will this day bring?

I slept so long and very well.
About boundless dreams I can tell.

I can feel the sun is shining.
A new morning makes his signing.

The tiredness disappears.
And in the distance I hear cheers.

On the horizon the sun arise.
Everything is born in front of my eyes.
