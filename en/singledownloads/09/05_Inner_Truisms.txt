Inner Truisms

Give me an empty page and I'll start dreaming.
Inspire me and my thoughts start screaming.

In me fresh verses are already waiting.
Now give me a pen and I'll start creating.

Out of nowhere I'll create what I need.
My mind is finally unleashed and freed.

My thoughts are just starting to wander.
About my way I'll not longer ponder.

Always the destination in sight.
I have with me the greatest might.

I'll preach this everywhere and everytime:
Inner freedom starts with a honest rhyme!
