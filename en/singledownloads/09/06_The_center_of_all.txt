The center of all

Now simply close your eyes.
And be free from all the lies.

In front of you is the eternity.
Fully packed with every alternity.

Now imagine what's behind you.
Isn't it the infinity too?

Also to your left and to your right;
Arround only the eternity is in sight!

And now find the middle of all this.
Realize it and receive your bliss!
