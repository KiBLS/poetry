A great unit

The time to set off is coming.
But before I leave I am summing.

Under this beautiful sun.
We are all linked up to one.

No one is separated from the whole.
Connecting everything is the goal.

Everything interacts with each other.
Not only the father with the mother.

Every little thought and every deed.
Keeps the whole thing in proceed.

This is not only whispered by a few.
Every detail has its origin in you!
