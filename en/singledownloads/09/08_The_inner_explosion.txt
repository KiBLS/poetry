The inner explosion

My vibration increases when I write.
On this way I ignite my inner light!

Its able to glow like a bright star.
And many can recognize it from afar!

The consciousness changes its state.
And I am not longer afraid.

I am pure light and I will now shine!
I am pure light and I will now align!

You will know me by my word everywhere!
Cause "our mind" behaves like a loving pair!
