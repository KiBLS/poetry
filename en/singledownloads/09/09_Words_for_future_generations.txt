Words for future generations

I hope you know what i mean!
When I say; keep your mind clean!

Leave everything harmful behind you!
See everything from a different view!

Do not scam or harm others!
Start to treat them like brothers!

Just exchange your ideas freely!
Such change we need really!

The future is influenced by the past.
But only what you feel right now will last!
