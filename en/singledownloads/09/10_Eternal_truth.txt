Eternal truth

Every source simply lies within you!
So easy experienceable but who knew?

I don't believe in a guy in the clouds.
A selfish one who rules over all crowds.

A thinking guy who demands sacrifice?
His judgements are accepted and precise?

Time turns faith into understanding.
And a seed grows only by its planting.

One word is so much degenerated with time.
In the past this word was full sublime.

The personification is the first separation!
On this way they have divided every nation!

Remember, nothing has ever been apart!
And the whole life is a harmonious art!
