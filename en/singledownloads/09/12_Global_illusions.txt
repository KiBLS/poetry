Global illusions

You know that the chair is only an illusion!
You know that the world is full of confusion.

Everything is mirrored to the outside!
Whether cold, warm, black or white!

It doesn't matter if something is round or flat!
Both perspectives are only created in your head!

Your vision lets everything arise.
An own creation right in front of your eyes.

Every little detail and every grain of dust.
Everything plays and vie for your trust.

The inside is just mirrored to the outside.
This old view shall serve as new guide.
