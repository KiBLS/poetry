Ongoing practice

I announce it loudly with my verses!
"I am" is the center of all universes!

It doesn't matter where this center goes,
It'll remain the center that simply glows.

This light creates absolutely everything!
Summer, winter, autumn and the spring.

Each observer determines the final blend!
And so the result of every ongoing experiment.

Everything you can see in front of your eyes!
Is your personal and timeless exercise!
