The last passing hour

I am not talking about any mystery!
What I am doing here is writing history!

In me awakened an irrepressible power.
Right now it is ringing my biggest hour.

The fog lifts and clarity comes in.
It was long been written that I'll win.

Hypnotically attractive and yet despised.
Ephemeral and yet forever immortalized.

Just one last awakening, one last strike.
And everything will work the way I like.
