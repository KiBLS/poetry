The sacred path

My body is built with sacred geometry.
My path is as unique as my poetry.

I just can go on, there's no more stop.
In my quest, I push everything to the top.

A wandering to the ancient highlands.
On my way I will leave diamonds.

Immortal thoughts for future generations.
A new era without oppressive nations.

Everything will change and develope.
To finally create a totally new scope.
