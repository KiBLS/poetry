It's not for sale!

I am enlightened, but what now?
In this society unprofitable somehow!

Nothing changed, everything stayed the same.
Everybody just keeps playing their game.

And yet it have changed every goal.
And mainly my own view of the whole.

I realized that this isn't the end.
I only dared the first ascent!

The way to the top is finally free.
That's why many more will follow me.

A new mindset in process of exchanging.
And thus the whole world is changing.
