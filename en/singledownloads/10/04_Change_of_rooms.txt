Change of rooms

It was my own decision!
To overcome this division.

Leaving the old load behind.
To strengthen the own mind.

To unite the separated.
To awake the unlocated.

To make blind people see.
Providing them a matching key.

Just capabilities to enter a new room.
Where miracles starts again to bloom.
