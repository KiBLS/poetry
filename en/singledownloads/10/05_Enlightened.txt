Enlightened

A new day follows the long night.
Darkness frees the room for new light.

Constantly change is part of the whole.
Love is the main ingredient of any soul.

It is the inner peace that I have found.
Now I can determine rules for the next round.

Ancient wisdom I let out of the bag.
Thereby "Victory" is written on my flag.

Beyond any imagination grows my winning!
Because I'm describing this new beginning.
