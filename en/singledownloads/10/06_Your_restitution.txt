Your restitution

My body belongs exclusively to me.
Now I will let my thoughts free!

You can oppress me as much as you want!
Repeatedly I will get up and run to the front.

I am going to break the old chain.
Starting a new era with no reign.

You'll be witness with your own eyes.
How the venerable Phoenix will now rise.
