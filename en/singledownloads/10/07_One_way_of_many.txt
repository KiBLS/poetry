One way of many

My mind was strongly sedated.
And I have never really meditated.

Always done what I thought was right.
And yet I've never noticed my own light.

So many problems and so few solutions.
They died painfully; all my illusions.

And at the end, just before the turnaround.
It was my own insanity which I have found.

My whole self was suddenly disintegrated.
There was nothing left that could be rated.

And how the butterfly slips out of its cocoon,
I finally received the greatest boon.
