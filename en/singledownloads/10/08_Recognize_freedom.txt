Recognize freedom

Like a regal lion I wanted to roar.
While I was breaking through every door.

I wanted to get faster with every meter.
And I was sprinting like a cheetah.

A big steam roller I used to clear the road.
Like a terminator I was in a destroying mode.

My quest turned me into a real berserker.
But honestly I became just a simple worker.

In this way the time until now has passed.
But another change will happen very fast.

All burdens and worries are suddenly gone.
After I realized that I've already won.
