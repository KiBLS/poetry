A new teaching area

I'll find words that change the world!
My thoughts are already unfurled.

Nothing from the outside will stop me.
Because I can imagine how it could be.

With a vision of love deep in the heart.
I will now realize the highest art.

The alchemy has long been known.
But now the alphilosophy will be shown.

Your own intentions make it practicable.
The effects are just unimaginable.

The seeds have already been planted.
A first impression was just granted.
