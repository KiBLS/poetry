A unified dream

My inner light is on fire.
It easily unmasks every liar.

The Inner voice now takes the lead.
And thus it will revise every creed.

The inner world begins to shine.
I can recognize my inner shrine.

Pure creativity circulates in my mind.
The outside world is simply redefined.

All thought frames will be removed.
And thereby every change is approved.

All the frequencies just synchronize.
That in the end an unified dream can arise.
