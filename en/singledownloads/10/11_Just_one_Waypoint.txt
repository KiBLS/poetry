Just one Waypoint

What is the purpose of this trip, you wonder?
Your whole ego will finally go under!

But that's not all!
The curtain will also fall!

You will see and recognize "it"!
Each role will suddenly quit.

But that only happens when you're alone!
It hits your mind like a stone!

You'll never forget this moment!
First a real shock, then a true bestowment.

Everything will make sense.
You realize a totally new tense.

Just keep walking your own way!
And listen what your inner leader say!
