That's my new path!

I have thoughts that are rare.
I write about wisdoms, to bare.

No matter what others ever said.
I just keep going ahead.

I know truth from experience.
And that makes a difference!

All mental blocks have been dissolved.
And something new evolved.

Its more beautiful than any butterfly.
Cause all answers appeared for every why.

It's just the dawn of a new age.
The wisdom erupts now from its cage.
