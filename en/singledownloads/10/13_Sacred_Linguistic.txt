Sacred Linguistic

Even if I still sometimes drop.
But now I run to the top!

Even if sometimes I write strange.
But now I write for change!

Even if some verses makes no sense.
They are able to break every defense!

The whole mind just renews.
And all dreams simply fuse.

Mankind awakens through sunshine,
and water transforms again into wine.
