Celestial Barriers

The inner creativity just flows!
On this way I write historical rows.

I still see an empty screen.
The display is still clean.

Words and ideas bubble out of me.
I can't help but let them go free.

Verses manifest word by word.
They simply make themselves heard.

They come from the mind to the virtual paper!
And they fly far above every skyscraper.
