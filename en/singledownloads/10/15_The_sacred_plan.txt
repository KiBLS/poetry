The sacred plan

My whole being serves only one aim.
And the great whole pursues the same.

I just try to spread enlightenment.
This is a humanities legal entitlement.

A holistic illusion is revealed.
A holy covenant is resealed.

This epiphany moment ends every program,
to finally terminates every previous scam.

Holy enlightenment through everyone's madness.
followed by the recognition of one's own badness.

And what some will lead to their end,
will be for others just a new ascent.
