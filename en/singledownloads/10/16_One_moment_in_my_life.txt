One moment in my life

Reading my own poems was like the red pill.
To reach enlightenment without my own will.

It just happened on its own.
When I was in my room alone.

It was like a heavy bang on the head.
The whole stage play was suddenly dead.

Every burden fell right off me.
And immediately I felt free.

Everyone plays his role sacrificially.
Hooray for the holy Allphilosophy.

The description doesn't fit in any book.
It's perfection down to the smallest nook!
