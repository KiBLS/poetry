Philanthropic reformation

I let my light shine, it will never end!
Like a firm lighthouse I will never bend!

A bright beam illuminates everything dark.
It radiates like an igniting spark.

An extensive light is now triggered.
Each observer will be re-configured.

Selflessness annihilate every frustration.
Healing begins without any hesitation.

Mankind is acting united with a common goal.
Philanthropic thoughts working for the whole.

By uncovering the final deception,
we will all reach true perfection.
