Program correction

Actually, I'm already crowned.
Now my mind is racing around.

Does that make me a winner?
Or am I just a holy sinner?

Words straight from the heart.
Showing a long forgotten art.

Suppressed truths are just rising.
They don't need any kind of advertising.

They'll correct simply your basic program.
Because the old one is steeped in a scam.
