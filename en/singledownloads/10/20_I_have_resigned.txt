I've resigned!

I can no longer pretend for 8 hours a day.
It is time that I walk my own way!

I have absolutely no idea where I'm going.
But deep inside I have a reassuring knowing.

My thoughts were tearing me apart inside.
More than 8 hours a day my inner life died.

Now I wanna leave in peace and let myself fall.
I surrender to the unknown to finally stand tall.

I will now grow and be wise.
I will be like a phoenix that rise.

So let my new journey now start!
From now I'll follow only my heart!
