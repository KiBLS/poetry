You are special!

With you I love to stay.
You make me smile every day.

You're the dearest of all.
You hold me when I fall.

You're the brightest light in the town.
You speak well with me when I'm down.

You support me in difficult times.
You stay forever in my rhymes.

I am the paper and you are the pen.
And every morning we will write again.
