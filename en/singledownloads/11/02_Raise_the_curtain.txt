Raise the curtain!

Oh, you great stage work in front of my eyes.
You show me the truth right next to lies.

I can see the good seed directly in the evil.
I recognize your visions in times of upheaval.

You are doing real miracles all over the land.
Everything of yours is so perfectly planned.

I am born straight from you, and here I go.
You created me from the head to the toe.

Now I leave the winter and welcome the spring.
Together we will transform everything.
