Reality lover

No matter where you live!
This life has so much to give!

Simply banish the gray!
And start enjoying this day!

After a storm the rainbow is drawn.
Such perfection will just go on.

Simply let your heart bloom!
Recognize your changing playroom!

There's so much to discover!
Just enjoy reality like a lover.
