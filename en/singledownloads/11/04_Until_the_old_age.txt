Until the old age

You're everything I dream of.
You're indeed my true love!

There will be just me and you forever.
We both achieve just everything together!

No power in the world can stop us!
We have no differences to discuss.

You keep going with me at walking pace.
We'll soon discover a wonderful place.

And in many decades we both will remember.
That we were together every year from January to December.

With you I could never be in strife.
Because you're the greatest joy in my life.
