The opening tune

I surrender all my heart,
to this beautiful art.

I can feel the beat of nature,
while i watch its portraiture.

The flowers starts to dance in the breeze
This beauty compels me on my knees.

Everything vibrates and lights up.
Nature now finally stands up!

I can recognize all the power.
For nature is now ringing in its hour.
