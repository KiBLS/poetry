Now more than ever!

Even if no one ever reads my book,
I'll write it only for myself!

Even if no one ever follows my path,
I'll walk it only for myself!

Even if no one ever sees what I'm doing,
I'll do it only for myself!

Even if no one ever watch how I reach the goal,
I'll reach it only for myself!
