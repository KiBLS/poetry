The own perception

What you can see or read.
Is exactly what you need!

What you can smell or taste.
Is exactly what needs to be faced!

What you can perceive and feel.
Is exactly what you need to heal!

Just everything around of you.
Has always been here and is not new.

Thought filter creates your perception.
Because everything is pure deception!
