Hello and welcome!

Welcome to a marvelous reality!
A single moment full of similarity.

Just start watching carefully!
And all realities unite cheerfully.

Enjoy your dream right now.
Please, let me show you how!

But don't focus on any bad!
Because this could make you sad!

Create everything first in your mind!
And it will be happiness that you'll find.

Know that all will happen anyhow!
And start to live your dreams right now!
