The melody of freedom

We are the voices that no longer fall silent.
We are the ones who hum the song of freedom.

It works like a catchy tune in your head.
Our song grabs the evil by its head.

Everyone's freedom is the supreme good!
It takes courage to announce this loudly.

Our melody echoes also in the last corners.
To wake up even the last sleepers.

The change is already in full swing!
But development sometimes takes a long time!

Our serenade gets louder and louder.
Our melody sounds more and more familiar.
