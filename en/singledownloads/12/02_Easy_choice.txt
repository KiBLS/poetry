Easy choice

Distract yourself with unimportant things?
Or start to think for yourself?

Deal with unnecessary things?
Or start to strengthen yourself?

Keep turning in endless circles?
Or start to see for yourself?

Sue each other in processes?
Or dare a new beginning?

You always have the free choice!
That makes the whole life so awesome!
