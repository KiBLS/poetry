Prophetic merits

The prophet in his own country.
Appears outwardly full of shame.

The message reaches its recipient.
The transmission simply takes a little longer.

Words of a very special kind!
They open your inner gate.

The effect is highly efficient.
And at the same time recursive!

The intention, it is always the same!
This change, it is truly extensive!

The moment is being reshaped!
Thoughts completely new normed!
