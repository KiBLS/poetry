It starts

Artificially created envy.
Produces a special kind of suffering.

Energetically charged explosions!
Interwoven with confused illusions!

This time all the fuses are burning!
This change will come from below!

Mankind has conjured it!
The old system is already for a long time lost!

Everyone cries out for change!
It appears after the last trade!
