War and Peace

There's a host of legions lining up!
The story now takes its course.

The great spectacle, it begins.
The outcome is already long' determined!

We are now in transition!
Soon nothing is of importance anymore!

Your whole being will be restructured!
While everything seems to collapse all around.

You have found the true core!
Now begin to explore it in detail!
