Your freedom!

Now write your own words!
Only they open the forgotten gate!

Read them carefully and thoroughly!
Remember - at best hourly!

You will then transform everything!
It will happen then just like that!

Nobody can stop this process!
In the end you will simply top everything!

When many realities merge,
it has worldwide consequences!
