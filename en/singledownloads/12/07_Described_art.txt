Described art

Creativity is discovered and lived!
Deep inside me, it truly quakes everywhere!

Words that simply sprout,
and colours that flow together!

Everything harmonizes and plays together.
The creativity, it is igniting!

Potential to change the whole world!
Art spreads in all countries!

It comes from the inside to the outside.
From deep indoors to far outdoors.

The change sees the light!
The new world moves in sight!
