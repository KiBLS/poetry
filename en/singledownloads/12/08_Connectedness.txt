Connectedness

I'm listening to your loud scream!
And you think it doesn't bother me.

It shakes me deep in my marrow.
But for you I remain strong!

Even if you seek the distance!
I stand nevertheless at your side!

If you need me, I am always there!
Every single day, the entire year!

No matter if it storms, rains or snows.
My support is always at your disposal!
