Rays of perdition

Something hurts me a lot inside:
It's the effects of 5G.

The tolerability was determined?
The SAR value is labeled "scientific"?

It imitates a human subject?
A water balloon as test object?

The microwave on the head for hours.
One voluntarily and gladly pushes the button.

The blood circulation is inhibited and totally clotted.
The whole brain becomes stupid in the long run!

But even apart from the health mania!
Or from Bluetooth, infrared and wireless Lan!

Every single beam is reflected!
Thus every material is simply declared.

An area-wide, documented irradiation.
A locating of all rooms justifies the payment.
