A dual system

I create the wrong and the real.
I create the left and the right.

I connect and I disconnect.
I am good and I am bad.

I bury and I dig up treasures.
I unite all opposites within me.

I am here and I am there.
I come and I go away.

An illusion creates friend and foe.
An illusion that divides and unites.
