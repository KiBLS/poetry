Overcoming the contradiction

These words will change your life!
These words will lift you up!

The sacred, it'll break through all pores.
The sacred, it's being born again.

Everywhere you look, you can see it!
Everywhere contradictions are burning!

Come over here and tear me down!
I'll still sing songs of freedom!

Contradict me and I'll clear up!
Suppress me and I'll stand up!

I don't care if others like it!
I'll change now the whole world!
