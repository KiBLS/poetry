In the valley of boredom

The clock, it turns.
But time, it does not pass.

No minutes, no hours.
Showing the end of time.

Everything is just an illusion.
The visual appearance is very subtle.

The question that now arises;
does anything in this world actually happen?

Or does everything in this world happen all at once?
The course of time - the true tribulation?

The time - it resides deep inside of you.
where all truths have been shimmering forever.
