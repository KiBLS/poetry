The new life

Today's the day!
It is finally happening!

The seedling is breaking out of the ground.
The seeds reach out to the sunlight.

The real adventure now begins,
A new child is born now.

A totally unknown variety.
The change is knocking at the door.

The light is now being focused!
A new vision is now integrated!
