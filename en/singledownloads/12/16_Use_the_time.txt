Use the time!

The history can teach you,
and the future should be honoured.

But precious is only this moment,
for it is never separate.

The "now" influences the times.
Let this "now" be your guide!

The timeline will be broken,
this has been promised for a long time.

Previous boundaries are blurring,
by inner tones that are in tune.

Just let this change happen.
Thereby old suffering will pass away!
