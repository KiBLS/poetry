A change full of light

He who seeks his end shall shape it.
And he who seeks redemption shall receive it.

Where are the true sages of this world?
Do they all sell themselves here for money?

It was once in times past,
where enlightened beings guided the people.

Today a virtual god is doing this,
in a shell of electronic waste.

He blinds every true seeker,
and sells alms for usury.

But in such truly dark times,
the light will once again take the path.

For only in the deepest darkness,
can the light be recognized with certainty.

It will shine brighter than ever before!
The power of the heart will soon open the gate.
