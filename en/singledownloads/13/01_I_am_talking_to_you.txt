I'm talking to you!

You're in command now!
Let me show you how!

You're one who take control with ease!
Let me help you stand up from your knees!

You're one of those who is able to stand!
Let me help you, I'll give you my hand!

You're the one! There is only you!
Let me help you make your dreams come true.

The "here and now" is your own reality!
And you are the one with the matching key!
