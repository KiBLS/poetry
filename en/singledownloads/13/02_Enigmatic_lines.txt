Enigmatic lines

The page in front of me is still clean.
But I can recognize a very personal scene.

Bit by bit I fill this mysteriousness leaf.
Of course I'll try to keep it brief.

Now the foundation stone has been laid.
And the middle part was finally made.

Now I can approach the conclusion.
And in the end will appear the solution?

The end has now been reached.
With no proof, nobody get impeached.
