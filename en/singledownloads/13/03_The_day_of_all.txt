The day of all

We're all fighting the same fight!
We all try to win with our light!

The darkness alone - it cannot shine!
But light can transform water into wine!

The darkness can never touch the light!
Because it just radiates so bright!

Only if the light shines weaker sometimes,
it seems that darkness grows with crimes.

But once the light starts to shine again.
It will simply shatter every chain.

A big change is drawing near for everyone!
Nothing is able to block the light of a sun.
