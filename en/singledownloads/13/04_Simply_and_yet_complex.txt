Simply and yet complex

The words begin to glow.
The rhymes begin to grow.
The mass begin to know.

A world changer!
A world stranger!
A world ranger!

Hiking through illusions.
Living with confusions.
Creating own conclusions.

Recognizing hidden signs!
Reading between the lines!
Realizing new designs!

Thoughts of a new way!
Thoughts of a new day!
Because we're all here to stay!
