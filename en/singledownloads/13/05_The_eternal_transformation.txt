The eternal transformation

Matter and time - an endless illusion!
Searching salvation in a delusion?

A real transformation is in progress.
The butterfly receives a new dress!

A core which is ready to grow!
A core that can infinetely glow!

It will bannish every old devil!
By pushing art to a new level!

A caterpillar or butterfly have never existed!
It's all the same - just shapeshifted!
