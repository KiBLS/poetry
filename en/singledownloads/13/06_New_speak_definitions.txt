New speak definitions

In the past we used to say; you're a slave.
Nowadays we just say; your job is save.

In the past we used to call them slave lords.
Nowadays we talk about entrepreneur hordes.

In the past, we called it contaminated waste.
Nowadays people eat it and love the taste.

In the past, we called it toxical affair.
Nowadays we believe that we breath clean air.

In the past we all had no idea!
But soon humanity will see clear!
