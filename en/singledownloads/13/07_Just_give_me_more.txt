Just give me more!

The greed in many is so deeply rooted.
Their whole spirit is heavy polluted!

They're just demanding more and more.
They treat others like a little whore.

So many give so much, but never enough!
Opressed to work all day in a modern handcuff.

Fortunately, nowadays the whip is forbidden.
But unfortunately, inner wounds are deeply hidden!

So many people are blinded and degenerated by greed.
They drive into their abyss with the highest speed!
