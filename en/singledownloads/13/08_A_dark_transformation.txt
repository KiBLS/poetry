A dark transformation

Listen to the unmistakeable playing army drum.
And recognize that first the dark times will come.

Whole hordes will just be slaughtered.
With blood the whole earth is watered.

Whole cities will just let dust on a heap.
And the whole humanity begins to weep.

Old things stay behind and we must say goodbye.
The caterpillar becomes finally a butterfly.

Humanity has never awakened in this way before.
The view is extended and there is so much to explore.
