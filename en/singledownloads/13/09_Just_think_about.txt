Just think about!

Simply imagine if someone invents a name.
Now imagine he would join this game.

It's not his name, so actually he doesn't care about,
but he's acting with it successfully in the crowd.

This fantasy figure now easily earns money,
and is ordering not only expensive honey.

Covered by anonymity is approved every legal crime!
And the numbers are just rising all the time.

Now it is time for the next step.
A real company in the world wide web.

Goods and numbers finally lost their worth.
And this invented name want to rule all over the earth.

But what would be the end of this story?
The character dies and some faded glory?

Or does the whole madness just continue?
And futured generations don't know what's true?
