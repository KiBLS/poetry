Enlighten me!

Today I'll tell you what's meant by waking up.
First your ego will totally breaking up.

Then you will experience connectedness.
But yet everything stay expectedness.

Then your mind will start to realign.
And you'll witness water into wine.

All your burdens fall abrupt away from you.
In this way you can design everything new.

The shell of the caterpillar finally breaks.
And the beautiful butterfly suddenly awakes.
