An inner conflict

A solution is expensive, further problems are cheap.
Inner conflicts can gnaw inside of you very deep.

Be honest and pay attention to your inner voice!
Trust only yourself and nobody else by choice!

You create the outside world from the inside first!
Change everything at origin and all evil burst!

Seize the power that sleep within yours!
This is the way we change the world and stop wars!

You alone have this power deep inside you!
But I think you know that's nothing new.

Let the outside world just run wild!
To finally rediscover your inner child.

Because we are all here to play.
And to give each other a great day!
