Light show

Light illuminates every crack.
It's an enormous, sacred attack.

An old spell has been spoken.
Thus the seal has been broken.

These changes will be extreme.
New times begin in a holy dream.

Old and dirty chains are simply broken.
And a new consciousness has awoken.

Simply recognize your inner, ancient bond.
And show the world what it have spawned.
