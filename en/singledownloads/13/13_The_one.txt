The one

The new day begins and light falls in.
Sunlight warms up easily the skin.

Is it just me who came alone?
Is it just me wearing the crown?

Can you be just as clear?
Can you be just as near?

Time dawns, the masks come down.
A king is born out of a clown.

He simply frees the entire brain.
And connectedness is experienced again.
