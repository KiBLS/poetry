Turning point of ages

You know exactly what I want from you!
You know exactly what we have to do!

You know the time is near!
You know the moment is here!

While gipsies curse and nuns are praying.
While drums are drumming and pipes are playing.

Listen to the unmistakable wake-up call!
And when we begin to demand freedom for all!

Our demands will become very concrete.
But together, you and I will succeed!
