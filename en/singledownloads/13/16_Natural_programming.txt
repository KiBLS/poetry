Natural programming

I can take down your firewall with ease.
It will feel like a little breeze.

I write in the highest programming language.
I will just bypass your main switch.

No internal virus can stop my corrections.
Because they stand up to all inspections.

An ancient code pushes everything to the top.
The all-philosopher is just doing his job.

The seed has been sown.
Now it grows on its own.
