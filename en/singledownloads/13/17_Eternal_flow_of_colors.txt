Eternal flow of colors

Colored lights begin to shine,
they seem like a clear sign.

Energy rises from the deep.
This moment I'd love to keep.

Everywhere it begins to glow.
Ans slowly I'm beginning to know.

Everething I can feel and see.
Everything radiates out of me.

The source lies deep within you.
Not easy to find, but it is true!

With this knowledge as key,
you're able to unlock the eternity!
