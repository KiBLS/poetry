Behind the mountains

I like to hike in the shadows!
Very far away but yet so close.

I like to live in the background.
Almost invisible but still to be found.

You want to interact with me?
You want something new to see?

I welcome you with pleasure.
Come share with me some leisure.

So we can fantasize together,
to overcome the bad weather.

Sometimes familar, sometimes strange.
But everthing is subject to change.
