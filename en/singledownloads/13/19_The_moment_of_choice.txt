The moment of choice

I can watch and complain.
And pretend it's all in vain.

I can despair and lose all hope,
and proclaim it is not my scope.

But I could also do otherwise!
And find my inner words to rise.

I could just say what I don't appreciate.
To give my inner feelings more weight.

That way I could grow and inspire others.
That one day we can treat ourselves like brothers.
