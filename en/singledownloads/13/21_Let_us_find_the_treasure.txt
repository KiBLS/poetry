Let's find the treasure!

How can the world be improved?
How can all this be excused?

I'll tell you a secret now!
It works like a seed that I sow.

Self-reflection is the key to bliss!
Embrace and give yourself a kiss!

Just sit down and just start writing!
Your treasure map will be very exciting!

In this way your inner light is ignited,
and your whole self will be delighted!

And finally your hour will strike!
And life becomes simply dreamlike.
