The ticking clock

Can you also see only the strange?
And are you looking for the change?

Then I would like to welcome you!
We both know where we have to go through!

We are the new game-changers!
And we are old world-rangers!

Even if this road will be very hard.
Mankind will become wise and smart!

We are all protected by an ancient shield.
All the game-changers are soon sealed!

So we'll enter the field of play!
To finally show the world a new way!
