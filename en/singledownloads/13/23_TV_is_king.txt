TV is king

I believe every word you say!
You are the reason why I pray.

Your holy pictures I admire so much.
They give my life an exciting touch.

Please give me more of those dreams!
I 'm addicted to your information streams!

With ease you play with my inner fears.
I love it when your melodies penetrate my ears.

Oh dear TV, how can I ever thank you?
For controlling my entire mind and view?
