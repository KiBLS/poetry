Break the ceiling

I'll be rushing upstairs very soon.
I'm going to aim for the moon.

There are no further fears or any limit.
You can recognize it in my serious mimic!

Weird fantasies become serious.
Now I am even more curious.

What will I end up with?
Will I receive a blessing kiss?

Whatever is waiting for me.
Now I'll sail into an unknown sea.
