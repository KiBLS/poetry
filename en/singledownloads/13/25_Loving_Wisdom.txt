Loving Wisdom

My weapons are the words.
My verses are like swords.

My protective shield is pure reason.
It accompanies me through every season.

My inner voice is guiding.
Far ahead my mind is riding.

The change has just proceeded.
Every limit has been exceeded.

Wisdom strikes like a grenade.
And wins every future debate.

Love generates all the wisdom.
And love will change this system.
