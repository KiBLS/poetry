Waves of thought

We're wandering through ancient fables.
We're the real sacred untouchables!

Our protection comes from above.
And our wisdom comes from love.

Grant to the divine the birth.
And togehther we'll save this earth.

We'll take it and we don't discuss.
This pitch is created especially for us!

We are living the transformation.
We are creating a true sensation.

The end will just be a new start.
For this we fight with our full heart!
