Lie Dream Media

Faked subscribers.
And wannabe writers.

Neurolinguistic tricks.
And manipulated clicks.

Enchanting pictures.
And weird mind mixtures.

Artificial characteristics.
And faked statistics.

The business of fear.
Repeats just every year.

The more awake we become.
The more we rise from the media slum.

Soon we act in a collective.
And we'll reach our objective.
