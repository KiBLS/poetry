We're already here!

Enlightened beings are present.
We are the ones who never bend!

It takes a long time to get over it.
But in the end, "being" becomes a hit!

This little moment changes everything.
And you will become crowned like a king.

The old fears disappear piece by piece.
While the own confidence grows with ease.

And when this transformation is done.
Finally many individuals act as one.

The old reality is just being dropped.
This sacred change cannot be stopped!
