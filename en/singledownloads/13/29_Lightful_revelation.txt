Lightful revelation

The truth just enters the field.
Thereby all lies will be revealed.

We will teach the divided.
We will help the misguided!

It is time for the great mind exchange.
Together we stand now here for change!

When we have to argue, we keep calm!
We will repeat the truth like a psalm!

We're gonna to stop this mankind treason!
We're the ancient voice of reason!

Recognize that there is no enemy to fight!
And now just unleash your inner light.

Start to shine like a twinkling star!
To show the world who we really are!
