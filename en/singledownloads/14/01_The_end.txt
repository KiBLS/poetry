The end

The words "come" will fall.
Then there will be a real bang.

The great mass has awakened.
The last fire has kindled.

They break chains and the dungeon.
Free and unleashed; true berserkers.

Half mankind is crazy!
The great purification begins.

The masses will be united mentally.
The triumph appears at the horizon.

The last chapter becomes fulfilled,
and thus unveils a new paradise.
