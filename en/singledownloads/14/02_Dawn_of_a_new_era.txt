Dawn of a new era

You have your own madness to climb!
You know that now this is the time!

You can read it in all the falling drops.
And sparrows whistle it from the rooftops.

A time that is long announced and awaited.
A time that is long feared and also hated.

The awakening of all hearts.
The inner revolution starts.

Be joyful and just start singing!
The Liberty Bell is finally ringing!
