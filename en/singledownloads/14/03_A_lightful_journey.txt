A lightful journey

Many lights are starting to glow.
Many people are starting to know.

All lights are getting brighter.
The whole reality act as igniter.

The wheel of fate is now spinning.
The end of times are soon beginning.

And the deception is right next door.
Be aware and start searching your core!

Something new will then been born.
It'll be more beautiful than any unicorn.

Like the caterpillar becomes a butterfly.
Your journey will create a new high.
