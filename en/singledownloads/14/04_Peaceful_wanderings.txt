Peaceful wanderings

Soon the time will come.
When the feet will drum.

Old chains just break.
And humanity will awake.

We all have to study and teach.
The truth is our common speech.

Wise men will finally travel.
Consciousness on a new level.

We're tracking the signs,
by creating sacred rhymes.
