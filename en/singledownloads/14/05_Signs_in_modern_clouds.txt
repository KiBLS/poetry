This time I would like to start with a little bible quote even though I am not a supporter of any religion (Quote from "Acts/Joel 2:17"):

>>>> Start of quote:

"No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: In the last days, God says, I will pour out My Spirit on all people; your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. Even on My menservants and maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy."

>>>> End of quote.

Signs in "modern clouds"

They're just prophecies for the blind.
For the initiated, everything is aligned.

Even the most sacred idol fades away,
when your inner voice starts to pray.

It works like an earwig in your head,
and suddenly you'll see the living dead.

All this had been known for a long time,
and here I describe it again with a rhyme.

You are part of the whole and never separated!
Please recognize that this insight is awaited!

Matter and time are only an illusion!
I hope this clears up at least some confusion.

All mankind will be eternally connected!
Therefore, the big change is now expected!

And finally as brightly shining as a star,
you'll recognize who you really are.
