The dark night of all souls

We are entering a delicate phase,
everywhere it begins hefty to blaze.

But we are still at the beginning!
It's the start of the time of sinning.

Resist all the vices before your eyes.
And do not trust all the cheap lies!

The fight will rage for a long time.
It'll be fought until the last dime.

Money will definitively lose its power.
This will be the dawn of the holy hour.

When everyone is utterly desperate.
We'll have fulfilled our needed fate.

Then the world will blossom anew.
And the sky will again turn dark blue.
