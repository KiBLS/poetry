A final choice

The time of the rapture is approaching.
I'll soon be ready for my master coaching.

At the same time, the persecution begins.
And many people will succumb to their sins.

Everything was long predicted and described.
For a short time, an evil order will be applied.

It'll not become an easy time for a dissident.
Because the global genocide is imminent.

Still unimaginable for most of the population.
But "the beast" will rage in every nation.

He who does not submit to evil is blessed.
For the good is still beating in his breast.

And those who love truth and know it.
These write a new future and compose it.
