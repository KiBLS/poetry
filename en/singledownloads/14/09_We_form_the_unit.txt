We form the unit

The coming times will be quite rough,
but for all of us it will be very tough.

But you must never lose sight of the goal.
Because we all work together on the whole.

Many will not endure these hard times.
Because it'll happen incredible crimes.

But we continue to pull in the same direction.
We'll never accept any kind of subjection!

We are the ones who came to stay!
We'll continue steadfastly on our way!

We have recognised ourselves and desire unity.
We're acting as natural and sacred community.
