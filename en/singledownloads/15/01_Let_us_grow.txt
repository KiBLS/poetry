Let us grow!

Welcome to my new poetry collection.
Soon we all approach true perfection.

We'll exist beside the confusions,
and we'll hold all the solutions.

Our string of wisdom becomes only thicker,
The promised change comes always quicker.

Matter and time - its really an illusion!
That is the onliest logical conclusion.

We'll let go of all confusing lies!
Thus we exceed our previous size!
