The new poetry level

A new wave of poetry is moving.
The inner life is now improving.

Harmful visions dissolve somehow.
This change is happening right now!

Prophetic poetry is on the advance.
And brings all thoughts in balance!

Poems that unite everything in the inside.
Poems that unite everything worlwide.

The light now ends dark crimes.
And that will make for great times.
