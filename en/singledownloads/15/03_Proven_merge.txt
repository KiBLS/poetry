Proven merge

You want a proof of the change?
You are already in my thought-range!

I influence you with every single line.
Thereby everything will become fine.

Ancient philosophy mixed with own words!
By doing so, I create modern, sacred swords.

Invulnerable, unassailable and indispensable.
The entire reality is now fully extensible.

Thought barriers are being completely removed.
The whole being becomes considerably improved.

Just take a look at how everything flows.
And enjoy the union of many individual shows.
