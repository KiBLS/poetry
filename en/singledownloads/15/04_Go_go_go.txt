Go, go, go!

I walk to protect an ancient truth.
I walk to protect an innocent youth.

I speak loudly and clearly,
so that everyone can hear me.

Under the eyes of all.
I'll follow the freedom call!

While I play our song please hum with me!
I'm gonna push forward now, please come with me!

A new world soon appears before all eyes,
and humanity will break free of its old ties.
