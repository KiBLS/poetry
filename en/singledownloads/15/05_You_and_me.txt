You and me

I love it when I can inspire you!
We both aspire to something new.

I'm gonna make a move that you can witness.
I'm going to get back to you your mental fitness.

Be aware of this one thing!
Everything we do is inspiring!

Your value cannot be measured in gold.
You live the story that is being told.

You're as wonderful as I am!
You're perfect gram by gram!
