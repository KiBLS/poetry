I'm behind you!

Together we'll face the foe.
Beyond our borders we have to go.

I will stand behind you in this fight.
I'll cover your back with all my might.

Together we are fighting at the front.
Together we will win and go far beyond.

It is a new future that we will write!
Ancient power is awakening from inside.

Shall this be the last battle we have to face.
Let's perform this last dance with full grace!
