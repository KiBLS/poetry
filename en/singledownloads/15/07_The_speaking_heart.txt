The speaking heart

Hello! I am your heart!
But I am not very smart.

Me and your brain work like this;
Together we create a true state of bliss.

Deep in me I can feel this infinite power!
My electric field unfolds like a beautiful flower.

This field is able to radiate like a sun.
Electric and magnetic forces works until I've won.

My power goes far beyond any imagination,
This is the way I create true salvation.

Hello! I am your talking heart!
Are you ready for a new start?
