A new teaching area

Your heart is working perfectly and great.
But your mind still blocks the gate!

You must align your longing with your mind.
And suddenly you are not longer blind!

Your whole world will change!
Even if it still sounds strange!

The two most powerful forces you can use.
United in harmony, they can never lose!

Feel the energy deep inside you!
And now start to create everything anew!
