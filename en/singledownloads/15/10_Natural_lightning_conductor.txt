Natural lightning conductor

Walk barefoot, it will ground you!
But this technique is nothing new!

All our ancient ancestors knew it.
But our modern society blew it.

Tight socks impede the blood circulation.
Without them your feet can feel a salvation.

Every modern radiation that can be found.
Are simply discharged into the ground.

Start to feel the earth and feel protected!
Thus your whole energy field will be corrected.
