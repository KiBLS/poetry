Future assistance

Many lies can drive you insane!
But now the truth begins its reign.

From now you are able to see the truth.
And the entire reality becomes a muse.

Pass on wisdom and knowledge to all!
And together tear down the last wall.

Forgive each other the old crimes!
And witnesses this new start in rhymes.

This sacred era begins on its own way.
And now; everybody prepare to play!
