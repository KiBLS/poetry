Waiting for change?

Now we're all sitting safely at home.
And it collapses the old lying dome.

But should everything continue as before?
Slavery, poisoning, brainwashing and more?

Is your desire for freedom getting stronger?
And don't you want to take it any longer?

Self-responsibility is the magic word,
to finally leave the sleeping herd.

Don't be tempted again by the wrong force.
And don't let the donkey be sold as a horse.

You will know what is wrong and true.
This change begins right now within you!
