Our common fate

You have nowhere to stay!
Finally you'll have to play!

You have nowhere to hide!
This will be the most difficult ride.

You have nowhere to run to!
This is the time when dreams come true!

And what are you dreaming about?
Write it down and call it out!

Here we go and we're all in!
Finally we are all here to win!
