External deceptions

You have the right to be irradiated,
and thus to become fully evaluated.

You have the right to the cheapest food,
and strong additives to prevent a bad mood.

You have the right to be vaccinated,
Until your resistance and health has faded.

But who gives you your beloved rights?
And against whom do you make these fights?

Take your freedom! But who you are gonna ask?
To find a "granting person" is really a difficult task!

But you can laugh about yourself in the end!
Because finally you'll find your inner friend!
