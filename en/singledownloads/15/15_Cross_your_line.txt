Cross your line!

To be a cog in a wheel without any variety.
Do you want to rot in this dead society?

Every minute and hour already fully planned?
Do you want to be ready every day on demand?

Tell me how you plan your sudden feelings!
How do you plan your inner life or dealings?

True answers can be found by a reflected view.
No one's going to take that important job from you!

Go into yourself and start the dialogue!
And lift thereby the last veil of fog!

Push until the last thought-fuse explodes.
And suddenly the whole reality decodes.
