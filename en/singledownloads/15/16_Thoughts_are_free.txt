Thoughts are free!

How do you want to go on, in your life?
Constantly walking on the edge of a knife?

Is the next propaganda orgy really worthwhile?
Or will it maybe again destroy your smile?

I have no idea where we're going either.
But if we keep this up, we won't be wiser.

Your thoughts are the commodity at stake.
Do you feel deep inside yourself that quake?

Now start to detoxify your body and mind!
Together we'll free the thoughts of mankind!

Unleash your mind, just start to feel that ease!
And in the end we all get up from our knees.
