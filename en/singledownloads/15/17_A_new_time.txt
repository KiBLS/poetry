A new time

The old fades away, it's a new beginning!
Now you also have the chance of winning.

We all take care for the balance of power.
We all ring in a new era and the final hour.

Every human being will be affected.
Every human mind will be connected.

The colorgame begins before the eyes.
The truth finally defeats ancient lies.

The present builds your whole reality!
And only "now" you can be really free!

An eternal, running moment, can you guess it?
Here and now your new life starts, bless it!
