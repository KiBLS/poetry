Light at the horizon

The trumpets sound now very loud.
You can feel the outrage of the crowd.

A new era begins to shine very bright.
And finally all lies come to light.

Many wounds will be deep and profound.
And drag you down to the deepest ground.

For many, it will be an arduous run.
But this change has now truly begun!

New players appear suddenly on the field.
That the hidden can be finally revealed.

In the darkness you can discern the light.
Go and strive for it with all your might!
