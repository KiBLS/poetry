The sun awakens

When the game becomes harder,
it just means you were smarter!

Because the previous level you've completed.
So now a higher level of difficulty is needed.

But now pat yourself on the back.
And stop painting everything so black!

You've made the journey this far!
Now you just have to realize who you are!

The old night and darkness is almost gone.
But your personal morning has already begun!
