Welcome to the change

Yes! Let's walk again together!
No matter what kind of weather!

Scorching sun or fiery wind.
We are back again to win.

The old burdens won't hold us back!
No matter how hard they'll attack!

With new dreams on the horizon.
And the sun which keeps up rising.

We are sailing through the waves.
Leaving behind Platon's cave.

Our curiosity outweighs any fear.
Welcome to the change, right now and here!
