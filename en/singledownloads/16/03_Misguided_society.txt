Misguided society

Many people trust no one other.
Cause they know about Big Brother.

Many people are inner divided!
Cause real help was never provided!

Many people are torn apart inside.
Cause they never had a trustful guide.

In this world where right is wrong,
Many failed to keep up strong.

In this world where wrong is right,
Many walked into the darkest night.

And for many light is still far,
far away like a bright star.
