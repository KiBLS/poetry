Timeless aspects

Every minute and every hour!
I can feel inside of me this power!

Every day and every week!
Each moment is just unique!

Every year and every decade!
All that time, I've successfully played!

Every now and then I think.
How times flies just in a blink.

Getting stronger, getting wiser,
To become your own advisor.

Travelling as one with the inner guide.
To finally enjoy the greatest ride.
