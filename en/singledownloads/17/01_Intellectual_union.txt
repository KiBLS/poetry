Intellectual union

We were waiting to be heard.
And now masters raise the word!

The freedom to change a system.
True power is growing by wisdom.

Many lies and suffering we were facing.
But our power is truly all-embracing.

What we were taught did not please our soul!
Unified power operates now beyond all control.

Mental synchronizations are becoming strong.
Come and join us! Let's sing the freedom song!
