Together at the front line

We all share a common goal!
We all develope the whole!

We fight for an ancient truth!
There is nothing here to lose!

People want to worship a horned cow!
So let us publish all the wisdom now!

We are releasing the shackles of doubt,
To liberate reason and spread it about.

The critical mass will be soon aware.
From this point on we will play really fair.

In this we all have concepts to reveal.
To rise up together and collectively heal.
