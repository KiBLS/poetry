Chapter of awakening

Philosophers, raise your voice.
Let us ascend, we have no choice!

Now get the words out of your heart.
Let's show mankind this ancient art!

Where wisdom reigns everything flowers.
They come from deep within - eternally powers.

Answer the call and write to exist.
Philosophers', you must fight to persist!

The battle begins alone inside of you.
And after your success, we create everything anew.
