Reach for the stars

No matter where I ever go.
I am like water in a flow.

I can see the beauty everywhere.
Simply by becoming more aware.

This world wants to be explored!
This call has long been ignored.

The earth beneath my feet is living.
In front of me is the nature to dive in.

The Sky is above me and is so amazing.
Countless stars are what I'm chasing.

Stars so close, I never noticed it before.
Now I'm ready to experience so much more!
