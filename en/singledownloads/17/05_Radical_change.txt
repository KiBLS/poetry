Radical change

The shadow play before your eyes.
A final exposure of all lies.

Everyone recognizes that he is locked.
Everyone who looks around is shocked.

So many lights illuminate now the darkness.
This is why all shadows appear in full sharpness.

All responses given were never true!
The onliest honest answer lies within you!
