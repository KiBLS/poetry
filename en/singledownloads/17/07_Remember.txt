Remember!

We are part of the oldest collective.
We all follow an ancient directive.

We have a single voice to speak.
And yet each one of us is unique!

We know the non-existent cause.
So we preserve these ancient laws.

We all can listen to the playing drum.
Individual minds are all linked as one.

And now all things they seem to scatter.
As all we see apears to shatter.

So still the ancient voice within.
Connect as once we did again.

We are a part of the oldest collective.
We remember our roots and change the perspective.
