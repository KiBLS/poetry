The way of the heart

I don't always write the right things!
But I always listen what my heart sings!

I don't always walk the right ways.
But I always listen what my heart says!

My inner voice is always around.
It supports me when I am downed.

It steers me back when danger is near.
And teaches me to love without any fear.

I trust in its truth and power,
it blossoms within me like a flower.

And when I doubt if some motives are pure,
I listen to my heart then I can be sure.
