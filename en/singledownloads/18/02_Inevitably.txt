Inevitably

I am speaking to every nation!
I am here for your inspiration!

I will show you what is wrong!
I will show you where you belong!

We finally see what we can achieve,
when in each other we truly believe.

Our consciousness is searching a new height.
So weâ€™ll stand together side by side.

Our thoughts are acting as one.
Because of this, we've already won!
