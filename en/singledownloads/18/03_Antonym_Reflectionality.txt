Antonym Reflectionality

How will everything change and when?
This day is now almost over again.

I feel ready for the great transmit!
When will I be able to feel just some of it?

Please tell me when comes the time?
When will I be full sublime?

When the evil will burn?
When will come this great turn?

But wait! I can now feel it begin.
The changes are coming from deep within.

And now, at last, Iâ€™m starting to see.
That this great change begins with you and me.
