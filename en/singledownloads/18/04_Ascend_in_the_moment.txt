Ascend in the moment

You don't notice your own decay,
when stress makes your hair turn grey.

Permanently only the time in view.
Always looking for something new.

Distracted with the daily grind.
Forgetting how to nourish the mind.

Rushing through life like it is a race.
Not noticing life’s beauty and grace.

Don’t live in the future, it’s uncertain.
Be present before it’s the final curtain.
