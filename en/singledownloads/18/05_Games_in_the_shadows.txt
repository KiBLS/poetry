Games in the shadows

You are developing within the money economy.
You know we play here a game called monopoly.

You might still stand while everything goes down.
But you know that we all lose our crown.

Cogs in a wheel in perpetual motion,
Steer towards a financial explosion.

Measuring our worth in digital paper.
Knowing that we'll all be cast aside later.

But we know true worth lies outside of this ruse,
If we know the game is rigged no one will lose!
