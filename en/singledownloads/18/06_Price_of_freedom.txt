Price of freedom

Your freedom is not yet lost!
But it is at stake, at great cost.

Stand up now make yourself heard!
Just rise up like a holy Phoenix bird!

The words act as fire accelerants.
My inflamed heart starts to dance.

We all have a mission to follow.
Pursue it like there's no tomorrow.

Each will make their contribution.
As we collaborate to create the solution.

The stakes are high and we cannot fail.
Humanity's freedom will prevail.
