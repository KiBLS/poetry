Blocked by a chain

A chain never sets you free!
It forces you to your knee!

Your freedom is "blocked" by a chain!
These blocking chains already reign.

The gag's getting for real tighter,
but the darkness is also getting brighter!

The light will break all these chains!
To finally dissolve never ending pains.

The only way to finally end this fight,
is to allow yourself to bathe in the light.

To realise and awaken your true potential.
To become your own master, it's essential!
