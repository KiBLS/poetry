Move down the curtain

Now it follows blow by blow.
We'll deliver a great show!

The feeling is incredibly pleasurable!
And the quality is no longer measurable!

We will never, ever bow!
We will climb up from below!

Our true selves are at last discovered.
Our destinies will be finally uncovered.

And our connection to all that has been.
Will show us the way that was before unseen.
