The global exposure

You think our problem is just local?
The truth is it is already global!

You think the poverty is just in your land?
It's organised worldwide by a hidden hand.

Everywhere you can see so much confusion!
And many poeple are searching "the solution".

Greedy fingers, like tentacles grasp everything.
All mysterious signs form a coherent string.

Let the eternal truth be finally revealed!
Nothing remains hidden on a holy field!
