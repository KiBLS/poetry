Rise during the downfall

We eat poisoned food to stay alive.
But in this way, we cannot thrive!

A permanent extermination is ongoing.
Contaminated water for growing.

Ruthless we harm future generations.
And rob them of all their foundations.

We need healing vibrations to echo inside.
Restore balance with nature to turn back the tide.

For we are what we produce and consume.
And if we can't fix this we are headed for doom.
