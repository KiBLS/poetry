Poetic Endeavours

You must feel the bond between you and me,
And your mind has to be completely free,

So you can dive into the unconscious mind,
You'll be happily amazed at what you find.

It feels so bizarre at first,
But gems of thought are given birth.

They synchronize and flow into position.
And then there at last, is my composition.
