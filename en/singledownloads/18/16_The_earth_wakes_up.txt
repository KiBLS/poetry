The earth wakes up

The natural protection seems a little outdated.
But the security program has been activated!

The entire human race is under attack!
And the enemy fights under a false flag.

Lies and crimes were constantly swollen.
And sacred symbols were abused and stolen!

Like a cancer that grows from the inside.
Many of us have taken a dangerous ride.

But before mankind finally falls apart.
It rises from everywhere - the holiest art!

We realize that we are all long since gifted.
Because all ancient mental blocks are lifted!

And our true selves will finally flower.
As veils are lifted, we’ll unleash our power.

Our foes have long since feared this waking.
When all of humanity’s chains start breaking.

Because we have always held the key.
To emancipate ourselves from their misery.

The mirror of illusion will shatter at last.
As we reclaim our birth-rite and links to our past.

We’ll march forward united towards a rebirth.
And spread healing energy throughout the earth.
