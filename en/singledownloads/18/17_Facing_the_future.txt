Facing the future

How many death rays do we still have to sow?
Before we grasp that this harms everything that we grow?

How much more water do we still have to pollute?
Before we realize that we took a wrong route.

How much air do we still want to contaminate?
Before we realize that doom becomes our fate.

How much more blood is to be shed?
Till we realise we’ve took to the devil's bed

What will it take for the world to awaken?
To understand that we’ve all been mistaken?

Errors left uncorrected will lead to disaster.
Until we open our eyes and become our own master.

For all life is connected by sacred strands.
So the future truly resides in our hands.
