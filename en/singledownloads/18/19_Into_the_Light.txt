Into the Light

Intellectual freedom and natural life are at stake.
We'll release now any artificial mental brake.

The true philosophers are ready for the storm.
Spiritual warriors act together in a swarm.

We wake the sleeping and we teach the truth.
We'll not do it for ourselves, but for the youth!

Many people will immediately start to weep.
When old and holy truths rise from the deep.

Everything that was blocked by the poisonous hearts,
will be livened up again through our sacred arts!

Because soon we all know for what we are fighting for,
so the evil may win another battle but never the war!

Weâ€™re all fully armed with the power of love,
that those who oppose use can only dream of.

An ancient weapon unsurpassed in its might,
will be the deciding force in this great fight.

And as long as we cherish it, hold it dear!
They will not divide us through terror and fear!

The day when our potential is no longer subdued.
We'll end the greatest war that we have ever pursued.

And as we realize that the answer was inside.
it suddenly changed the whole game worldwide.

Shared potential unleashed with formidable energy,
will ignite the darkness, exposing our enemy.

Whose strength only ever lay in our confusion,
now shattered along with this grand illusion.
