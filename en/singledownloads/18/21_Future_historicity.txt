Future historicity

Very soon we will remember the old days.
When we listened to what a computer says.

As we followed numbers on a screen all day.
And when a machine was telling us the way.

When we thought; how big is all this madness?
And when we imposed on us all this sadness.

When a new reality tried to lure us,
with many empty promises to cure us.

We all have made big mistakes in the past!
But it's a fruitful warning that will last.

While they silently tried to change our genes,
we curiously followed all these colourful scenes.

And suddenly all the chosen ones awoke.
In a time when all around was rising smoke.

A time when the old system was inflamed.
When we all realized what it really aimed.

It was seriously already a very bad weather!
But suddenly all of humanity pulled together.

Some had learned to followed old directions.
Ones who understood all these connections.

Old wisdom was applied and taught.
Just before the final onslaught.

And as we headed on a collision course,
the people united with the source.

Which allowed the frequencies to retune.
So bad energies were tossed and strewn.

And when the tremors finally abated,
we found what we had long awaited.

Humanity was no longer lost and perplexed,
and became the true guardians of sacred texts.
