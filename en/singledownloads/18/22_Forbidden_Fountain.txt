Forbidden Fountain

The campaign is waged against father time.
By stars wishing to maintain their prime.

By cleansing of cells with impressive potions?
Or healthy food and fitness devotion?

Or the petals of youth gathered too soon?
To enhance an already withered bloom?

The nectar of a deadly sin today stands for vitality!
And promises each consumer a false immortality.

That binds evil fools to ungodly realms!
For decadence rang on perdition's bells!

A demonic legion supporting the forces of hell!
It's a really dark world where they live and dwell.

Bad frequencies are not only bound in the blood.
They're also received by the holy earth and mud!

But thus the emergency program has been activated.
For improvement has indeed been long awaited.

And all sweet lies now can be discerned,
so order can now be returned.

By disarming evil from sharpened knives,
and shielding young and innocent lives.
