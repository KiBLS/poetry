Not an easy road

You'll feel happiness right next to sadness.
The right path leads through your own madness!

It goes deeper and deeper into the rabbit holes.
It's gonna feel like you're walking on hot coals.

But by walking with self-reflection and reason,
You'll expose all the lies and every treason.

When you find your inner fortitude,
Your heart and soul will be renewed.

The light will shine more and more brightly.
And you will act more and more knightly.

The darkness will avoid you then!
They are afraid of the sacred wise men.

As more unite with the ancient source,
weâ€™ll unleash our spirit force.

Creative minds and courageous hearts,
is how our whole new beginning starts.

And all that is possible finally will be,
A world where at last, we can all be free.
