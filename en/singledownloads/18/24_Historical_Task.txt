Historical Task

I can imagine no prouder task,
to describe the end of every mask.

I announce the beginning of a new age,
in the book of life - just a new page!

What awaits us has long been proclaimed!
In many old stories it became framed.

It really did come at a high price!
But it will become a true paradise!

It already creates itself in the mind.
Thatâ€™s how our reality is defined.

We have the power to redesign,
a world that truly is divine.

When all mankind chooses to wisen,
A bright new future waits on the horizon.

And this moment will go down in history,
As the last stand which led to our victory.
