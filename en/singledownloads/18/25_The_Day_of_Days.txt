The Day of Days

Just a few honest people write true poetry.
They're yet to find liberating psychometry.

Sweet lies are still all that they can see.
But combined verses aim to set the mind free!

Today the ancient meanings are so very twisted.
And only more and more lies are further listed.

But once the truth is public and known,
The chosen ones will stand firm as a stone.

They’ll tune into every true cognition.
And help fulfil this sacred mission.

From this day wisdom spells will be cast,
with solemnity that’ll be unsurpassed.

We’ll trust our words with all their power.
And we'll dissolve all lies in this crucial hour.

Like a bullet shot with a holy literary expression,
We'll shatter the old forces of oppression.

Our verses will empower, uplift and liberate.
We'll spread all our love against the forces of hate.

Then humanity will stand up in all its glory.
And collectively we'll write a different story.
