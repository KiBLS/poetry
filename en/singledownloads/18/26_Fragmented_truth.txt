Fragmented truth

I will go where I have to go,
and I'll know what I have to know.

No one will stand in my way,
because I'm just here to play.

They are new benchmarks that I'll now set!
I'll follow my dreams, no wish stays unmet.

I know that I'm here to start to re-create.
My inner passion for life will never abate.

I just want to spread great inspirations,
So others can detect their inner relations.

Creative thoughts are already spinning
Thus I'll create this new beginning.
