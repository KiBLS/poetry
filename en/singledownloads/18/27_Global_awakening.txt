Global awakening

When no one is artificially influenced anymore,
then we will win and settle the final score.

When no one is buying for buying's sake,
then we'll rekindle the value in what we make.

When no one is giving to da evil his energy,
then we will experience the real sacred synergy.

When no one is told what he has to believe,
then true wisdom we will suddenly receive.

When no one is forced anymore to live in fear,
then we will know the great awakening is near.
