The departure

It doesn't matter if you're left or right.
In all of us burns the same light!

Humanity is the stake, and shall be bound.
Together we have to stand now our ground!

All sacred voices will soon be raised,
we won't watch all our rights erased.

And just as it happened in days long gone by,
we'll remove the fog to see the clear sky.

The truth will blaze in our minds and hearts.
And thus we'll reignite our vital sparks.

We all have to live here together.
Now we determine the future weather.

And again we will let the sacred sun shine!
We'll refine ourselves as water once became wine.
