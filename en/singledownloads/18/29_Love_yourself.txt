Love yourself!

Money should never be your life's goal.
It can never satisfy an holy soul!

Material things always come and go.
But you are an eternal, steady flow!

Property and possession will pass away.
Only you are the one who will always stay!

To strive only for success and monetary gain,
will lead you to only more misery and pain.

You're worth more that what you could accrue!
It can never be a reflection your selves true.

Gathering experiences, memories and learning,
Enriches you more that the money you're earning.

And if it really were to be soon stripped away.
Then what's eternal will finally win the day.
