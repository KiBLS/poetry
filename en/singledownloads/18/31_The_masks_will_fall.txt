The masks will fall

Wearing the slave mask even in public places?
Even when there are not many sick or fatal cases?

How broken does someone have to be in his head?
To think, in this way a virus cannot be spread?

Every influenza has more fatal cases to blame!
All those diktats and rules are a real shame!

One might think that all politicians are on drugs,
and in their brains could be parasites or even bugs.

Whoever obeys them has completely lost his mind!
They rely on us all being stupid and blind.

They want to start a controlled revolution.
And in the end, they present their own solution.

This will then become an even worse system.
But they did not count on mass wisdom.

Cause thanks to the diabolic Internet, we are a lot.
This is how they give themselves the mercy-shot.

Every lie is refuted in the shortest possible times!
And they cannot ban so many honest rhymes.

Each line, as a bullet hitting, firm and sure!
Blasts through this facade to reveal all that’s pure.

And the shards of lies that used to enslave,
will shatter, revealing each evil knave.

The honest meek will lead at humanity’s helm.
And all people will rise and reclaim their realm!
