Lightful change

I'm glad that the change is happening now.
Even if I still don't know the way or how.

I'm glad that the lies will come to an end.
The truth becomes more and more a trend.

Da evil now acts in totally desperation.
It doesn't recognize the chain of causation.

The good is recognised everywhere.
As evil's revealed it will be forced more to dare.

And we’ll take back the power we once gave away
So never again can this darkness hold sway.

A lesson learned by all those who now know,
Sowing seeds of awareness so hatred can’t grow.

We’ll move forward together and into the light,
To a world of pure beauty and sheer delight.
