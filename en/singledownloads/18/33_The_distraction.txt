The distraction

The division now really increases,
just because of relabeled diseases.

Living with lies, or searching the true.
Why should we test people for a flu?

Why should we stir up panic and fear?
When the redemptive truth is so near.

Faking a pandemic by false-positive results.
Punish small children, adolescents and adults?

100 positive tests result in countless false ones.
And they use these results against us like guns.

A labeling scam is monitored and constantly tested,
and the truth goes untreated and sorely neglected.

Some who’ve lost their lives in this plandemic,
are victims of an antithetical polemic.

The death waves that come are thus predicted,
until all our illusionary rights are restricted.

We won't accept any DNRs and No DNA revisions.
We’ll seize back the right to make our own decisions.
