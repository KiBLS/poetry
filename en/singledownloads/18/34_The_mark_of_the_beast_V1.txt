I do not support any religion! And yet I start again with a little Bible quote (Revelation 13:17):

"And the second beast required all people small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark— the name of the beast or the number of its name. Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and that number is 666."

The mark of the beast V.1

Without the mark you can't pay your rent!
Without the mark you've to sleep in a tent!

Without the mark you will lose your house!
Without the mark you can not longer browse!

You won't be able to drive a car anymore!
And buses and trains will lock their door!

The times have changed, did you the same?
The end nears, did you see through this game?

Yes, I know this message is now very hot!
But nowadays the devil pretends to be God!

Most people follow him voluntarily and blindly.
And feel they are being super honest and kindly.

Exploited traits of care and compassion,
to help us make foes while our reason’s on ration.

We see hell unleashed in what they are trying.
But soon we will rise and see through all the lying.

We’ll eschew the grave changes and what they decree.
We wear the belt of truth so will not bend the knee!

We will really awaken and stand above it all!
Alone we are small but as one we’ll stand tall!
