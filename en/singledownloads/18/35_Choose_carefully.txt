And again I start with a little bible quote and I want to mention again; I do not support any religion! (John 8:42-45):

"Jesus said to them, â€œIf God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me. Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you cannot hear My word. You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies."

Choose carefully!

Consider the free will and choose your side!
This kind of decision is made nationwide.

Either you fight for the lie or the truth.
Either you enslave or you free the youth!

A poisoned body and mind cannot think clearly!
And he can't see that evil is costing him dearly.

Without radical change, you've made your choice!
Decide wisely for whom you raise your voice!

So many sweet lies floating through the air!
Cause the devil doesn't really play fair!

When the top is down and the bottom is above.
When love becomes hate and hate becomes love.

In times where the lie rules and spreads.
Times when madmen try to take over the heads.

Remember you do not struggle alone!
There are holy seeds that have been sown.

The seeds of change with power of resolute,
and a message of wisdom they cannot pollute!
