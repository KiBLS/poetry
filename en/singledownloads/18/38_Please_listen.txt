Please listen!

I want to speak to the upcoming generation.
Those honoured young people of every nation.

Don’t make the same mistakes of bygone days.
Most have sold themselves as financial slaves.

We didn’t heed warnings learned before,
Unguarded minds were an open door.

For enough money, no questions were asked,
As we walked around in a communal mask.

The youngest we have sold and harmed imprudently.
And the worst of us were protected with immunity.

The laws enforced on the common person.
Could not touch those whose crimes would worsen.

Layer upon layer of liars and lies,
wrapped in our world by a pretty disguise.

Keep your eyes sharp as laser beams,
Awaken from your material dreams.

Stand in the strength of one who knows,
and realise that the emperor has no clothes.
