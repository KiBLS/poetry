Be aware of your power!

We live truly in historical times.
At every corner one can see crimes.

The madness is on the rise everywhere.
And open resentment hangs in the air.

The chaos now seems all pervading.
And many feel all hope is fading.

But we can’t give in to fear and doubt.
In us all burns a fire they can’t put out.

Feel it, feed it and help it to grow.
Spread it all around to the people you know.

And as so many come to finally understand.
False gods will be forced to show their hand.

Then this will unravel in front of their faces.
As together humanity holds all the aces.
