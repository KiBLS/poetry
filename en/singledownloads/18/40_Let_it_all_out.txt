Let it all out!

Now show everybody your artistic side!
There is no reason for you to hide!

Let words, colours and sounds play together!
And relieve yourself of all the pressure.

Listen to that quiet, unmistakable voice.
To create change, this is the only choice.

Each thought has its own unique frequency,
So express and be the change you wish to see.

There’s nothing to lose and it’s time to begin.
Let your warrior art flow out from within.

Your own truth is a needed part of the whole.
Thus we free ourselves from external control.

We’ll push past the boundary of our limitations,
Reclaiming the future for coming generations.
