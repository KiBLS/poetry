Welcome the golden age!

Through the dark night of the soul,
a lighting sun shines black as coal.

All your dreams are suddenly taken.
But that's how you'll really awaken.

We all slept so long and nicely.
I can still remember precisely!

Money and fame, power and greed.
But none of that is what we need!

Your new life can now be drawn!
Amazing times are about to dawn.

Shifting from the dark into a golden age.
The whole world is finally on the stage!

The new integrates into the old.
All this was long time foretold!
