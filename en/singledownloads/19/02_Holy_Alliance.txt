Holy Alliance

The whole of history interwoven with lies.
But I have seen the truth with my eyes!

I have seen the hidden sun!
Now I am witness of the One!

Every old religion reports about it!
And every modern society doubts it.

Now the last veil will finally fall.
Now I hear clearly the holy call.

Everywhere are working sacred lights!
And in the end the humanity unites.

True masters have already begun drawing.
So the golden age is now dawning!
