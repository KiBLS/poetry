Happy fulfillments

There's no reason for a single tear!
And there is no reason for any fear!

Now the most beautiful time begins!
Because the whole of humanity wins!

The unified dream comes true!
And the sky again turns blue!

The water and the earth will be revived.
The holy spirit has now finally arrived!

All we have to do is sit in the grass.
And old prophecies are coming to pass.
