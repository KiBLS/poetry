You are pure nature and all-knowing!
Develop yourself and keep on growing!

A mosaic is formed by many pieces.
And new clarity constantly increases.

He who controls the present, writes the past!
And so he can also change the future very fast!

Only here at this moment you are in control.
Come, I'll show you how to reach your goal.

I'll show you how to cross borders and grow.
What do you like? What do you want to know?

Sit down for a while and make yourself comfortable.
Because under stress or too loose you are vulnerable!

Just pay attention to your breath and relax your mind.
Close your eyes and it is peace that you will find!

Now your mind can connect easily with "all that is".
Mind structures are created and you experience a bliss!

A short time later all the answers will fall to you!
But believe me, this simple trick is nothing new!

This was known so long before and everybody knew it!
But also in this case; our modern society blew it!

So roll up your sleeves and sit down!
You just have to wait for your crown!
