Private crowning glory

I've seen so long all the misery.
And thus I lifted the last mystery.

The desperation was so deep in me.
I felt the opposite of being free.

But when the chains got too tight,
they were broken by a shining light.

I had no external help, no prospect, no savior.
And suddenly, one little moment changed my behavior.

The moment when the genius pushes its bounds.
Immediately the consciousness plays new sounds.

Finally I've seen some kind of empty spaced corona!
And that immediately erased every old persona.
