Towards the sun!

Connect with that what is!
To avoid any nasty tricks.

Just find your inner center!
Begin with an honest prayer!

If you just sit in nature,
you enjoy her pheromones pure!

Every answer you are looking for!
You will find by resting!

Sit quietly and barefoot on the floor,
after that you feel yourself lifted!

The Mycelial network welcomes you!
Have you now perceived its call for help?

But also the water in the air,
is filled with the scent of flowers.

Wonderful sounds and natural melodies!
Inspire not only to confused fantasies!

Ethereal scents, pollen and also terpenes,
all this has an influence on your genes!

And suddenly you're connected to everything!
And in nature all wounds will heal!

All your cells will suddenly start laughing.
And the new fire will be kindled inside of you.
