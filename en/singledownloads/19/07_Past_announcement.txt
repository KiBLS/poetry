Past announcement

I remember when I was a small boy.
We often used the forest as a toy!

We built many forts and shacks.
And wandered off the beaten tracks.

We have built dikes along small streams!
And briefly we lived according to our dreams.

How quickly these times have now faded.
Today this old time looks like grey shaded.

Today it's all about money and time.
Everybody's always chasing the next dime.

The joy and curiosity of the people is numb.
And they have no idea where they're from.

But in times of greatest darkness and pain.
The holy sun will shine brightly again!

Its light brings the final revelations!
The age of Aquarius full of sensations!

The change of times is about to begin.
The golden age has now been ushered in!
