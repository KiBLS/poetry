Sanctus Rubedo

The journey leads through the deepest abysses.
Through pain and suffering in all sizes.

While I wandered around, I was still a sleeper.
And the path led me down only ever deeper.

Through experience I have optimized my rhymes.
And I laughed in the face of death many times.

I wandered a long time through the dark.
And finally I discovered the hidden spark.

I have seen through the eternal deception.
I have seen the absolute and true perfection.

The black sun shines from deep within.
She is everything that has ever been!

Now it is growing again - a wonderful flower.
It unfolds slowly - the source of all power!

Who could ever block the light of the sun?
In the end you can expect the greatest fun!
