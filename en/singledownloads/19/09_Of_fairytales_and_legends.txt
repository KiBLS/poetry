Of fairytales and legends

When viruses can be stopped by a simple rag.
Then a fence also protects against a fly attack.

If a virus can be found with a useless PCR test,
then a fever thermometer can find a parasite nest.

Hopefully you realize how stupid all this sounds?
And that a measuring tape can't measure your pounds!

Our scientists are just as dumb as a shoe!
And they all tell bullshit out of the blue!

The Bible describes the sign of the beast!
And how much the evil will be increased.

We live in the end times, apocalypse, the last days.
It's written that an even worse system will soon raise.

All this madness will last about 3-5 years!
In this time will be shed many bitter tears.

Humanity will exterminate each other.
No one will then know his own brother.

But when all this is over, comes the golden age!
In our development the most beautiful stage!

Nothing and nobody can stop or halt this!
A day when the sun gives the world a blessed kiss.

Those who survive have been already selected!
With the highest their spirit is connected!

They know the true way and have experienced the truth.
They found inside themself, a sacred fountain of youth.

They will become the teachers of the new age!
They are masters of their emotions and rage.

No one can seduce the chosen ones now anymore!
They've seen the paradise and walked through the door.
