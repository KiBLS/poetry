Your life!

Do you still feel healthy and well?
Come sit down for a test of your cell!

They will store your DNA and use it!
DNA computers will definitely abuse it!

The entire DNA of humanity bundled together.
Would such a DNA-computer be somehow clever?

Can such "a beast" connect to quantum processors?
And independently track down potential aggressors?

Artificial controlled dogs already running around.
Luckily they still don't fight like a hellhound.

And it's good that Robocop is still in his garage!
I'm sure he was only built for a pleasant massage.

They still have not yet created the real beast!
But it will rage not only from west to east!

I really have nothing good to announce today.
But I'd like to share a "crude idea" about the way.

Dear sleepers! The coming times will not become great!
Together we'll stand in hell at the famous gate.

So many still try to save their own hoard.
And many more cry and call for the false lord!

This Lord will reveal himself and he come for you!
He's gonna chip you, tag you and program you anew!

Your financial worries will be a thing of the past.
And maybe just a memory of your old life will last!

Your new freedom is to serve under your true master.
But surprise, now you're owned by the Lord of Distaster!

Now you have to stay strong and endure 1000 years!
You can still listen from afar to our cries of cheers.

Two realities! Satan's followers and humanity!
Now you must for real choose with sanity!
