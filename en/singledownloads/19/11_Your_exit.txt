Your exit!

Release yourself from all ties!
The exit is in front of your eyes!

Every vibration of the mind is like a tune.
Every thought may become a curse or boon!

So pay attention to every single thought!
In the end you'll benefit from it a lot!

So start to take your unique supremacy!
Just feel love to change your frequency!

And when you have found the inner source.
You're able to determine the future course.
