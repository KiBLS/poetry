Sacred black sun!

From the ashes of the old system.
In the name of a banished emblem.

A kingdom will rise in all its glory!
It's coming true - the ancient story.

When you finally found your inner core,
the golden age is knocking at the door.

Can you imagine what we will soon achieve?
It's only the old system we must leave!

All things have long been foretold!
And many souls have not been sold!

The black sun shines in so many so brightly!
Mind warriors act brave and truly knightly.

Thoughts of all warrior's gather over airwaves.
We'll reach and connect through the deepest caves.

An unmanageable and incorruptible network of truth.
It'll not only save the old but also the youth!

Opening your eyes, it will not be in vain!
But the process will cause a lot of pain!

In the end there will only be a new beginning.
But after this transition, everybody is winning!

Recognize your inner light and start to shine!
You're able to transform water into wine!

Soon the divine shines brightly out of all pores.
The day it bursts forth, it'll shatter all doors.
