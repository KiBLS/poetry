Reading symbols...

Those who do not know the whole and true story,
shouldn't interpret symbols with hate or glory!

Interpreting symbols wrong does not help anyone!
Nowadays fakers use stolen symbols like a gun!

Who thinks the sites are clearly defined by signs,
is not able to read between the modern lines!

He is controlled by evil and distributes its lies.
Half-truths are dangerous and help the evil to disguise!

All good and evil have long been mixed up!
And wrong interpretations must be fixed up!

You can no longer trust the old symbols today!
Flags are not only black and white, but also grey!

Witch burnings are kindled by false accusations!
Today the evil doesn't sit in specific nations!

Neither everyone using a simple chessboard is bad!
But many wolves in sheep's clothing are acting mad!

Incorrect informations are spread and distributed!
And every attempt of a correction is simply muted!

Who doesn't know the history can't afford to judge!
He'd better learn more before he talks crap so much!

The holy truth is still hidden and was never revealed!
If you realize that, you find yourself on a battlefield!

The evil can take out the good still with sick passion.
And it's not so that people can still think with ration!

Pay attention to the words and read between the lines!
And don't pay so much attention to long stolen signs!
