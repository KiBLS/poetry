Natural order

If they sting, nobody punishes the bees.
So, in nature there are no guarantees!

Everyone is free to do what they like.
They can play, dance, jump or hike.

Be an enemy of nature or a friend of the bees!
Sinking in your thoughts or climbing trees!

Play with nature and recognize it as alive!
And behind you stands "not only" a beehive!

Whether you run barefoot or with a single shoe.
It's entirely your choice what you wanna do!

Nature will protect you with all her powers!
She can create earthquakes but also flowers!

She'll never tremble before any of the kings!
She'll blend in with the grand scheme of things.

Who should judge or condemn you in nature?
You're part of her great natural portraiture!

Every single move you make is simply amazing!
Alone your presence is the highest praising!

Every detail and situation - try to connect it!
And any old vice or guilt - simply forget it!

The past and the future meets in the present!
Now simply connect with the pheromonic scent!

Through inner peace and silence you will wake up!
And every old chain you can then easily break up!
