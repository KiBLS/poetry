Mystery history

Inside of me I have found a shiny, dark kernel.
I acknowledge that I have "found what is eternal".

It shines brighter than a thousand suns.
It can be heavier than a thousand tons.

It's always and forever at the same place.
It's always looking right into your face.

A holy revelation by the supreme!
It's the fulfillment of an old dream.

Many will be transformed from the earthly.
Because they were all found to be worthy!

This change will be unique in our history!
The day when we will all reveal the final mystery.
