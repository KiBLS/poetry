Corona wars

A new beastking will never be accepted!
This artificial coronation is rejected!

The plan was seen through globally.
Resistance grows not only locally!

A deep reflection back to the roots.
Like a choice between burgers or fruits.

Even though we're on the edge of a knife.
We have all decided to choose the life!

The kind hearts awaken to unite.
And people feel again their pride!

And as the horror story came to a sudden ending.
It was a new history that simply blend in.
