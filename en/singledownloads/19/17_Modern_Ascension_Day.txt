Modern Ascension Day

At some time - one who will full awaken!
The whole world will be suddenly shaken.

Fully awakened through his own power.
He rings in the system's final hour.

Flying, transformation, spinning flashes.
He rises like a phoenix from his ashes.

The greatest miracle of modern times.
He enjoys the protection of sacred rhymes.

Every knowing one will stand by his side.
He will only listen to his inner guide.

He will be untouchable and unerring!
All wisdom and knowledge he's bearing.

No more lies will stand in his holy ways.
Because it's only the truth that he prays.
