Living in fear?

I speak to all who spread fear without solution:
For the evil you spread horror and confusion!

Stop complaining and make it better!
Spread true solutions e.g. via newsletter!

Health is the most important point these days!
Whole humanity is highly poisoned and going astray.

Those who live also in fear are like paralyzed.
They have not the complete situation analyzed.

Fear stun the brain and toxins blocks the thinking.
And the own life force is more and more shrinking.

Becoming aware of the problems is only one aspect!
Who only spreads fear and scare appears suspect!

Spread more love and the old wisdom with it!
We need solutions - because we all miss it!

Finally the truth will banish the falsehood!
So that in the end all can become good.
