Everyone can follow!

Yes! I know that I can!
I'll find my roots again!

Yes! I will connect with the nature.
I'll explore the whole portraiture.

Ancient knowledge and wisdom unfold.
A long time this has been just told.

The new age is not a religion or belief!
It's the end of all this misery and grief.

New seeds were already planted.
The world of thought is now expanded.

The vibrations are constantly increasing.
It's eternal love that we're releasing!

The curtains will fall everywhere!
And mankind will become self-aware!

And you're already doing your part!
By learning from an ancient art!

So, feel inspired and find your own words!
Just start to whistle on like the birds.

But don't let it be a difficult hunt!
Just think about whatever you want!

Write them down and learn to interpret them!
Treat all your creations like a sacred gem!

Only your own words will open the gate.
And only your own mind can create!
