Holy inner sun!

How can I describe something that nobody understands?
Something that never really began and never ends?

Something that has no form and nobody could ever kill.
Something that's more powerful than any red pill?

Today no one can still interpret the ancient truth!
Old people teach great humbug to an unwitting youth.

But I want to try to enlighten everything!
Believe me it will become fascinating!

A bright and yet dark sun is the eternal source!
It created everything and is the elemental force.

It's simply everything and yet absolutely nothing.
It makes no difference between a beggar or a king.

It takes away all your fears and anxieties.
And erases your old self from all societies.

It shines out of you and its power is eternal!
It's the true and inexhaustible kernel.

The inner sun is known under many names nowadays!
But its existence is not just an empty phrase!

In all countries, old religions and ancient scriptures.
Everywhere inside this world you can find the pictures!

It connects everything and heralds the golden age.
After such dark times, it can be really seen as a wage.

All humanity will soon be able to grow and thrive!
A sacred dream comes true and everyone will have a good life.
