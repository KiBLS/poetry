A new leadership

All waiting for the "one command".
So that the evil can be finally banned.

The holy herd is still leaderless.
Because all speakers are featureless.

Finally mindful berserkers will rise!
But they are not mad, they are truly wise!

They learned to distinguish good from bad.
Most fight for kids because they're a dad.

They all know what this war is really about.
That's why they're screaming the truth out loud.

No one will take over the holy creation!
The truth will spread now in every nation!

How naive must one be to think that he should fear god?
The most sacred covenant will now end this fraud.

The eternal truth, it makes just perfect sense!
And it's also the best and most effective defence!
