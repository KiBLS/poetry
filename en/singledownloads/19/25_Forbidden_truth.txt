Forbidden truth

The truth you can find in poetry and fairy tales!
If we write it clear we're attacked by media whales.

Here in Germany the truth is long prohibited anyway!
We've to be proverbially careful what we say.

Old ladies get locked up when they talk about their lives.
Because the truth is more dangerous than any knife!

One is insulted, disparaged and also persecuted.
The truth is today strongly hated and polluted.

The truth has been twisted nowadays so much,
that it hurts your head when you get in touch.

But the time of change has now truly begun!
And from the very beginning the truth has won!
