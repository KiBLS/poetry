Final Mysteries

The time of the rapture - close at hand!
This story was for a long time planned!

Rejoice! After the chaos, it will be amazing!
Now it's our inner enemy we must facing!

Do you remember the evil stone text?
So everyone knows what happens next!

The falsified word serves as the script.
And everything good was simply flipped!

So many words were perverted and mixed up.
And old meanings were tried to be fix up.

So many prophets and seers have seen it!
They truly described it the way they mean it!

Also Sajaha was absolutely golden right!
Someone will come soon to end this night!

The golden age was heralded by the Ilu Ray.
Thus the new age receives its true birthday.

Almost every religion knows the source.
And many also describe the further course!

But also in the Edda and the Nordic mythology!
Wise men find the truth in every analogy!

You can be happy when you are innocent!
Because the last awakening is imminent!
