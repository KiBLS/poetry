The coming day

The day when the gods awoke.
The day of the final stroke.

The day when the world knew.
The day prophecies came true.

The day when the good were assembled.
It was the day when da-evil trembled.

A day when the evil was jailed.
And when justice prevailed.

It was the beginning of the golden age.
And suddenly all evil was in a cage.
