The golden era

Here from Germany this change will come!
You can already hear how our feets drum.

This time nothing can hold us!
Too many lies we were told us!

The jug of Aquarius is wide open!
The Age of Pisces is thus broken!

This change it becomes truly divine!
The black sun does already shine!

The whole world is now changed by its light!
Everyone is amazed about this primal might.

Right now the truth is being spread!
So the golden times are not far ahead!
