The source of change

Cheating and lying to each other.
Deceive and exploit him, your own brother.

Take the last dime he's got so you'II feel great?
So you've opened for hell your personal gate!

We've waited so long. We've been only mocked!
And every truth has been successfully blocked.

Nothing in this world is sacred anymore!
Everyone sells himself like a cheap whore!

Everyone who's still on the wrong side now.
Will see how the evil caresses him, and how!

Justice will rage throughout the world one day.
For the good it's just a little game they play.

Nothing can stop this holy new age!
And no good soul will be left in his cage!

The whole reality bends for the chosen ones!
Because to the sun they are the most loyal sons!

Nothing can stop the light of the sun!
From the very beginning it has won!
