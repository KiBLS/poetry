The hidden sun

I've seen the holiest and it was incredible!
I've experienced something indescribable.

I've found a hidden sun inside of me.
It works for me like the hidden magic key!

The black sun shines bright inside of all of you!
The holiest is calling to create everything anew!

Sacred wisdom, insight, knowledge and all power.
These are our forces for the systems final hour.

Are you ready for this light? It is already awake!
Internal frequencies are releasing an artificial brake!

Just sit down quietly to receive the holy tones!
It'll heal the body deeply, down to the bones.

We expose all lies and unmask the black sheep.
The ancient truth is what we're gonna keep!

Its rays will create a new reality.
And suddenly all thoughts are free!
