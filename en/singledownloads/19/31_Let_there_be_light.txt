Let there be light!

Soon we reach the point where all is said!
Then you can choose between life and death.

But there are people who have no choice anymore.
They've given themselves to the devil like a whore.

These are the ones who constantly twist the truth.
These are the ones who constantly seduce the youth.

Mighty rulers... but over a pile of dead bodies!
Conspiring into a bunch of blind acting lobbies.

They're hoarding not only banknotes and fantasy cash.
To prepare themself for the biggest financial crash!

And indeed it will be for many a really hard shift!
Because "their solution" is again a "trojan" gift.

Many devils will try to temp you again and again!
Trying to plant their thoughts deep inside your brain.

But it will be a futile fight for every dirty lie!
Cause the holiest will be seen by the inner eye!

Nothing can block this amazing and powerful light!
Because it is and has always been the greatest might!
