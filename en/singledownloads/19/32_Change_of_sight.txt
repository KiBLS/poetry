Change of sight

Many prophecies are being fulfilled.
And finally every lie will be killed.

I am born out of the hidden sun,
And I'll go back there when I'm done.

But this change will be so extensive.
And the price for it is very expensive!

Such a small minority has decided,
that everything must be divided.

By finally breaking our old slavery chain.
All this chaos comes to natural order again.

And when worldwide the life finally recovers.
We'll all recognize the most beautiful clovers.
