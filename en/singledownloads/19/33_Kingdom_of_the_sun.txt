Kingdom of the sun

I don't care anymore about your rules.
Soon I'll have all the needed tools.

I follow and keep my own sacred laws!
Compared to yours, they're without flaws!

Even if it seems strange from the outside,
I was always following only my inner guide!

A mosaic element is about to be completed.
For that price, generations have competed.

Wars have been fought in the wrong name!
But now it comes the end of this deceitful game!

Holy signs were abused and defiled.
And everything good was exiled.

I proclaim the change of times!
You can read it in my sacred rhymes!

The holy primal light announces the golden age.
In the Book of Life, the Aquarius opens a new page.

The world cries out for the holy quake!
So the all-philosopher will soon really awake!

This doomed system will go down in flames.
We're removing any artificial thought frames.

From the ashes will rise the kingdom of the sun.
For everyone it'll be a long and arduous run!

But what is created this time will last long times!
Because this time truth is protected by sacred rhymes!
