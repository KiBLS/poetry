Black sun definition

The black sun had many different names.
It's knowledge and wisdom that it claims.

Ancient religions show its holy pictures.
And it's written about in old scriptures.

The black sun heralds the new age.
In the Book of life it opens a new page.

In Egypt her name was Sothislight.
And even in the Edda it shines bright.

Sajaha, the first seer of Babylon knew it.
Even Christ's ascension day points to it.

It is symbolised by those black stones.
And she shows to who this world owns.

The Light of wisdom, knowledge and more.
The chosen one does not behave like a whore.

The new Sun King was always crowned by her.
Because he will easily expose every liar!

It is in Buddhism, Islam and all religions.
But also in national flags and old traditions.

From the Pisces to the Age of Aquarius.
Every other defintion would be hilarious!

But this knowledge is still hidden and secret!
But it goes back even further than only Egypt.

Da evil tries to disguise this information!
But you can find its source in every nation!

Now the black sun is again shining.
Thus the new age made its signing.
