Modern sun misinterpretations

It was never about the yellow sun over your heads!
It's not the source from which wisdom spreads!

It's the black sun deep inside that is at stake!
Only her holy light can make you really awake.

She is the source of all wisdom and knowledge!
In this way you can forget any school and college!

But She is also the source of your real power!
Once discovered, her light grows every hour.

Your black sun is connected to the true source!
It determines your life and your future course!

In old religions this knowledge was always known!
But your inner black sun never comes alone!

We are many who know and experienced the reality!
It shows you the naked truth without any fee!

And her light is also not black but ultraviolet!
The radiation changed its colour from infrared.

All this is still hidden in old pictures and beliefs!
The holy black sun is what will bring us all relief!
