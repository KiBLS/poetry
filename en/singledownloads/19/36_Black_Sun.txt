Black Sun

You amazing, holy black sun!
Your times have now begun!

You shine bright from deep within.
You're the sequel of a new creationring.

Your beam, it just creates.
Your light, it open gates!

You're for real the greatest!
You're the first and latest.

You're everything and nothing.
You're crowning every true king.

The black sun shines hidden in everyone!
By its beam the golden age has begun!
