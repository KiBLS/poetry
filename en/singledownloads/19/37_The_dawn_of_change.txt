The dawn of change

I've found peace deep inside,
thus my old ego has died.

I have discovered the holiest light.
The rays were dark and yet so bright.

Immediately every curtain and veil fell.
And I was suddenly freed from my cell.

I have never begged or asked for this!
And yet I've received that holy bliss.

This made my rhymes more intense.
And I recognized the primordial sense.

New and old ideas conquer the earth.
It was happening a renewed holy birth.

The Sothislicht appeared again,
to begin his holy and eternal reign.
