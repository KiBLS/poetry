Golden auras

We are heading for the golden age!
In Valhalla all are waiting and ready.

In both realms it will rage violently.
But we will be rewarded in victory.

The passing of time, the transfer of power
For a long time, many devils have laughed unrestrained

Firstborn, blood sacrifice, even fratricide?
Satan's lies will soon be seen in every corner!

Good and evil - in the meantime twisted poles!
But the truth serves the whole good!

True chaos breaks out all of a sudden.
Civil war! Every house will be on fire!

Old powers soon reappear.
And old victors will be crying on the ground.

This change - it's in full swing!
This change - it's taking very long this time!

The German country is in revolt again,
Philosophers now defend themselves against injustice.

Notice all the signs around you!
Because your environment was and is never silent!
