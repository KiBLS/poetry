Honest self adulation

The black sun shines out of me.
This holy light just loves me.

I want a change deep from my heart!
I'm going to play now my predestined part!

What do you want to reach with your number games?
Inside of me are burning a thousand sacred flames!

I am the one everyone is waiting for!
I've found my inner and eternal core!

My power will bring this holy change!
Even for me it still sounds strange!

But I feel this incredible power within me!
I let myself be surprised what it brings me.

I will soon awaken completely!
I will do it simple and discreetly!

Nothing can stand in my sacred way!
I see everything only as an eternal play.

My will shall soon become the law!
Because nobody yet believes what I saw!

But I'm in union with the most sacred!
My inner beeing was suddenly exposed naked!

I have been purified and also sanctified!
I'm the one whos mind was incredible amplified.
