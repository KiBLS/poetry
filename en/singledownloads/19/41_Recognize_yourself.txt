Recognize yourself

All my life I've been bleeding.
But now the darkness is receding.

I'm not the one who's coming.
I'm already here and humming.

I'm not who I once was.
I'm the one who saw the cause.

I'm the one who speaks strange.
I'm the one who brings change.

My message will be widely spread.
My thoughts just keep moving ahead.
