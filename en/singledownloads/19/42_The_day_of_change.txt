The day of change

The day has come! Finally I'll leave you!
Now I'm going to start my life anew!

From the forests of Odin, I now move out.
Nature awaits me, she calls out loud.

Without direction or fate in sight.
I simply trust the greatest might!

I have seen the promised Ilu light!
It was so incredibly deep and yet so bright.

Call it black sun, Sothislight or whatever!
A sight like that you'll forget never!

But if you saw that, you'll understand,
how the whole course of time is planned.

This enlightenment sizzles your brain.
And you're not just feeling unity again.

You're not the same, the theatre's done!
And suddenly you realize you've won.

All the power is now at your fingertips.
Soon the world will follow your scripts.

This change will be extreme and comprehensive.
In the end that price will have been expensive!

But nothing can stop this transformation.
And in the end there will be a real sensation!

So look forward to the coming times!
And forget about all your dimes!

Even if nobody yet know how,
this change will happen now!
