You have been chosen!

I'm sealed and protected by the Highest One,
because I've seen the deep of the holy sun!

After enlightenment I was led into temptations.
At all corners waited so many material sensations.

Money and power of unprecedented scales.
Was offered to me if I told only fairy tales.

I've resisted all these ridiculous attempts!
Because I'm not a weak one who simply bends!

I'll stand for what I believe in.
I'll stand above every cheapy sin.

But the devil does not make the rules for me!
An understanding of good and evil is the key!

And because I resisted, I am dignified!
I've been cleansed and my old ego died.

And some time after enlightenment it occurred.
That which cannot be described in any other word.

Someone with a golden aura gave me a seal.
I couldn't see a body but the light was real.

He only touched me on my forehead.
At this moment there was nothing said.

Through my whole body I could feel this light.
It was so filigree and yet so intense and bright.

I have never sensed love like this before!
I wanted to enjoy this light more and more!

I've never seen or felt anything so amazing.
That golden aura is just holy and blazing.

I wanna be able to glow like that too!
Such loving light can be emitated only by a few!

I want to shine golden and irradiate everything!
And suddenly there will be born the new king!
