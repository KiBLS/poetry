Times up!

We're like an eternal and holy formation!
Together we bring that transformation!

We Even agree when we disagree.
And we'll never bend the knee!

In the past we were all stifled and chained.
Now our mental powers rise unrestrained.

Our minds were the tools we hadn't explored.
But now useless thoughts will be ignored.

Knowledge we learned had so many flaws.
So we started our search about the cause.
