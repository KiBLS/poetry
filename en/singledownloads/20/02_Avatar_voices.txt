Avatar voices

The monkey and the butterfly.
Together they fly very high.

We will cross spiritual frontiers.
We will conquer ancient fears.

In front of everyone eyes.
We will defeat dirty lies.

Chosen to walk within the WAY.
We're talking about the day.

The holy nature has made its choice.
For the subconscious we rise our voice.
