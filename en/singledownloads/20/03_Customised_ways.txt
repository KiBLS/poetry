Customised ways

So many ways to choose but I walk mine!
I follow it and observe every sign.

Unimpressed, I saw the evil side.
There every truth was only denied.

Memories appeared through sacred signs.
And so I began to write true lines.

In my centre I've found the source.
I feel increasing waves of the force.

A hidden spark I found. I've freed the light.
And it helped me to enjoy a major sight.

I turned myself to the essence of love,
thus I received the blessing from above.

Inwardly satisfied and fully delighted.
At last I could feel completely united.
