Ripples

We know that everything is a lie and a sham.
We came here to end this endless scam.

Our lights start to shine unmistakable.
Our subconsciousness is unshakable.

Across all old borders and nations,
we'll spread our poetic sensations.

Just follow our example, be there!
Just relax and breathe in fresh air.

Spread the love across all borders.
Thus we create those new orders.
