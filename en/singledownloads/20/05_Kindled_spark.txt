Kindled spark

A true guild of honest poets is formed.
Thus every building of lies will be stormed.

We illuminate the darkness that still prevails.
Our light will simply surpass all the scales.

We strive for the change we want to see.
We know; our subconscious is the key!

Our history is only a theory, we need to unwind.
The new fire is kindled from the frame of mind.

We walked that road right up to the light.
To rearrange our thoughts is the real fight.
