Freeworld

Do not cling to your ego or name!
Both are part of the evil game.

Do not rely again on foreign pledges!
Because they're waiting at all edges!

Trust only your innermost core!
This is the only way to open the door!

In our modern world that you see.
The mind's confused by blind belief.

The written letters serves as images.
As personal scenes they appear limitless.

A new story board, on a green screen,
creates imaginations I have never seen.

Finally we have to go out to explore.
To realize that truth is providing more.
