Bring on the lights

The darkness is highly revered.
And the true light is still feared.

We bring the truth to light again.
To break every single old chain.

Connectedness and unity are the goals.
For this we will turn around the poles.

From when we are born until we are dead.
The blood of everyone is always red.

All the birds chirp and sing,
to everybody who is listening.

While the seasons change the way rotates.
Completely unaffected by human debates.

We the pawns play and act on our own.
And so we finally leave the gaming zone.
