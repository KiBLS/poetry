We know!

We are no longer in search.
Especially in no church.

The alpha and the omega.
Leads us soon into a new era.

An indescribable change is imminent.
It's predestined and very significant.

Unimaginable for the most.
For many, frightening as a ghost.

But nobody has anything to fear!
And nobody has to shed a single tear.

Time to laugh at what you thought.
That time has passed, the lesson taught.
