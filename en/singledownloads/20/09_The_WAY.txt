The WAY

Inside me lies every contradiction.
Because outside, everything is fiction.

The imagination creates perception.
And yet everything is a deception.

Only a few recognise the eternal true.
Their own delusion they had to go through.

To finally overcome their own sadness.
They just climbed up their own madness.

It is sad to see where we have been.
So obvious now, we have all seen.

We'll help those who have fallen behind.
We'll encourage those who did not yet find.
