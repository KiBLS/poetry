Work inside

Our words create a different view.
Thereby we light the fire in you.

We write straight from the heart.
For that we don't have to be smart.

For within you lies the wisdom.
This way works the whole system.

Don't let the outside distract you.
In order to be able to connect you.

You will open up from deep inside.
The phosphor will shine bright.

The passing loop of life will change you.
With new health, clarity shines through.
