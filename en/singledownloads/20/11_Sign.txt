Sign

Take me to the highest heights!
Show me the brightest lights!

Show me boundlessness of my mind.
Let me no longer be aimless and blind!

Show me what positive I can learn!
Let naked experience be what I earn.

Tell me about that enticing imagery.
Those hidden signs I should see.

There is no reason to feel longer blind.
We crossed those boundaries of the mind.
