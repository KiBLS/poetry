Listeners

You must have a lot to tell.
Every memory is like a spell.

They'll reshapes your own past.
For those lessons are fading fast.

Your thinking influences what will come.
Of your present thoughts, it'll be the sum.

The greatest impact is your feelings!
For they all have energetic meanings.

You're writing your history right now.
And these seeds will grow somehow.

Share all the thoughts that come to you.
So listeners can learn something new.
