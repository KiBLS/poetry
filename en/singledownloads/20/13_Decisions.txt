Decisions

It is only up to you if the new age,
will become just a new confined cage.

Your consciousness is the key!
To unlock the real infinity.

The decision is overdue and up to you.
A nasty way is replaced through a new.

Why be confined longer inside a cage.
Instead of entering into a new age?

Entertained with fictional fairy tales,
and lies that burn under the nails.

Consciously your acute mind can see,
that those storys can not be reality.

The deep fear that is holding you back,
which for a long time you couldn't crack.

The fear of opening yourself up to the whole.
The fear of being wounded deep in the soul.

It keeps you down and oppresses you.
But when you open up it blesses you!
