Spring time

The birds are singing today.
The snow melts and slips away.

Spring sends us a greeting,
and nature begins on speaking.

Listen to its enchanting tones.
Be it trees, plants or even stones.

What comes to mind from the words I hear.
The enchanting sounds that delight my ear.

Creating life at nature's speed.
Life still flows by while I read.
