Zodiacal distortion

An antient description of the zodiac.
An antient description is coming back.

In the endless sky it was always known,
as the circle of tiny animals it was shown.

Everthing revolve around the way.
The way we are, the way to be today.

It is the way and manner how we talk.
Words and sounds that learn to walk.

Everyone knows the antient zodiac view.
When it's shown to someone it's not new.

Distort facts with half-truths, an old trick.
This way they hid the way from the public.
