Mouth and nose protector

Mask yourself if you are not educated!
Stay ignorant and do as you are dictated.

Keep your distance when you're controlled.
Do not argue with anyone, just be cold!

Do not leave your house, as the covidiots say,
and don't let your children go out to play!

Equip little babies with a faceshield!
Until their mouth can be sealed.

Don't question anything and obey every command!
Don't get the idea that all this could be planned!

If the money becomes worthless, stay remain quiet!
And keep on with your proviso oxygen diet.

Drain your brain of as much oxygen as possible.
Just wear your mask! It's fully plausible!
