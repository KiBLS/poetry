Unit detection

We live in the middle of the holiest!
There's no need to feel loneliness!

We are what is and what was forever!
Who understands this is really clever!

Each individual is part of the whole!
To recognize this truth is the goal!

No matter what you ever observe.
Every straight line and every curve!

If you stand in front of someone else,
be aware he's composed of the same cells.

But even the chair and also the table!
Everything is wearing the same label!

We are all created and born from the one!
We are all children of the most holy sun!

No matter with whom you argue or disagree!
To recognize unity, that is the important key!
