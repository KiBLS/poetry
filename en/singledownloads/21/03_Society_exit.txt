Society exit

Now follow only your inner voice!
This is one of the wisest choice.

Don't let the outside tell you anything!
That way you will become a real king!

No one can defeat your sacred kingdom,
because you don't need anymore an income.

Neither do you need a single donation,
because you live in the middle of creation.

Recognize your uniqueness and simply wake up!
That way you will survive the final breakup.

Afterwards, everything will be united again.
The whole spectacle is only in your brain.

Your thoughts exists for the creation!
They never changed their real location.
