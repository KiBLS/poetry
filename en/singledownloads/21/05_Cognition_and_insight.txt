Cognition and insight

Even if the path seems tough.
No burden will be heavy enough.

Your power is endless and immense.
You do not need any kind of defence!

Your thoughts are boundless.
And your actings are soundless.

You walk the path everyone is looking for.
And you're able to go through that door.

Material things will just come to you.
Just hold on to the eternal true.

All matter is dominated by your mind!
Just go on while you stay nice and kind.

In retrospect, everything will make sense.
And no one will experience a real offence.
