The Hobo King?

A homeless hobo on his spiritual ways?
Becoming someone who no longer obeys.

I want to go new ways like a drum major!
I want to be free and live within nature!

I want to be one of the first to awaken!
Even if in the end I am completely mistaken.

My inner voice is so clear and distinct.
I just have to follow that ancient instinct!

I don't know the way or even my destination.
But in the end I'll feel that natural relation.

Many more will follow this sacred path.
Because it's the only way, just do the math!

Do you want to go on working for cash?
And wait at home for the financial crash?

The whole earth has already been bartered away.
They're just waiting for your personal decay.

Tagged, subjected and torn from the creation,
they'll claim their loot soon in every nation.

But grab into the pocket of a naked man,
even it's still part of their end time plan.

The last will become the first!
And the richest will be the worst.

The good will again be considered good.
And in the end eradicate falsehood.

What is all this worldly possession?
It only causes more and more aggression.

Everything is only illusion and deception!
Only through fear they create an exception!

You live in the holiest temple ever!
And into it they can break never!
