Live vegetarian!

It is written: Thou shalt not kill!
Not a single man or even an animal!

Meat ruins the body and the soul!
And slaughterhouses harm the whole!

Do not eat any kind of dead bodies!
Even if it's advertised by lobbies!

No animal wants to die or be killed!
Otherwise you'll swallow a huge guilt.

Every living being has an holy mind.
Don't be so stupid, reckless and blind!

Live on without eating rotten meat!
And pay attention to what you eat!
