To go or not to go?

What would you do if you were immortal?
Would you then search for the one portal?

Would you strive for higher things?
To end up spreading your wings?

Or would you succumb to worldly pleasures?
Accumulate power in an unimaginable measures?

Accumulating women, money and property?
And end up in a craze of full snobbery?

You are chosen from an infinite multitude.
Everything and nothing you have viewed.

You are someone who stands above all these vices!
You're aware that one fights for it at all prices.

The ascent is not given to you, you take it.
And your destiny, you cannot escape it!

The Alphilosophical Way is the supreme!
And it was initiated by the holy beam.
