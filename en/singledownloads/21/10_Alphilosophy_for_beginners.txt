Alphilosophy for beginners

Far above alchemy stands the alphilosophy.
It contains everything and is the true anthology.

Everyone's history and wisdom is accessible.
But in language it's not easily expressible!

But one can have access to everything!
That was known by every past Sun King!

For this reason not everyone gets an easy access!
Because you can loose everything or have success.

Only true masters reach this level of awareness!
Because you see everything in its pure bareness.

Shortly the Sun King will awaken again!
And true justice will once more reign!

He's connected to everything and knows every detail!
His sacred powers will be out of any known scale!

All time is only an illusion! It can still take years!
When he awakens, there will be shed joyful tears.

About the evil we do not need to talk any more!
Because for the golden age he opens the door!
