Illusory time

Soon faith becomes true knowledge.
Like a fantasy turns into a sketch.

The hidden will be revealed.
And the sick will be healed.

The good comes again to the top.
And the evil will be stopped.

The sacred change is taking place.
To put an end to a senseless chase.

The good will reign once again.
It'll break every evil chain.

In the end everything will be clear.
The day of change is drawing near.
