A new light

Within me lives the divinity.
I'm the origin of the Trinity.

The outside world is created by me.
With all this might I'll now align me.

Everything is in the same place!
Only my perception sorts the space.

My spirit is the most powerful tool!
My power of imagination is like a jewel.

There is nothing that I could not achieve!
This is my conviction and not only a belief!

I can live on light and see in the dark.
Because inside me glows an eternal spark!

A new age is what I'm going to proclaim.
Thus I'm going to set it now in flame!
