Extensive cleaning

Keep your body always clean.
To create the master gene.

Do the same with your mind.
It'll be unity that you find.

Create no suffering and no pain!
And you'll enter the holy terrain.

Just hold on to your inner tune!
To receive the greatest boon.

Many will not understand this path.
For their thoughts are full of wrath.

The inner intention produces the result.
In former times this knowledge was occult.

But this holy change can no longer be stopped.
The rise of consciousness is no longer blocked.

Whoever decides to do so has a lot to think about.
But in the end will disappear every single doubt.
