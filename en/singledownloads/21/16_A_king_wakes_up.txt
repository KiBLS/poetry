A king wakes up

I will live completely without time.
And also completely without a dime!

Only my own words and poems I will read.
Not longer influenced from others, I'm freed.

I only receive the naturally streams.
And I only enjoy my own dreams.

Every new day is only mine alone.
Everything before my eyes is my own.

But I claim nothing, I let everything grow!
I try to feel that holy and eternal flow.

I'll teach those who really want to learn.
And only their success will be what I earn.

I ask for nothing and want nothing!
Because in my world I'm now the true king.
