Spiritual master

I now announce the rapture!
It will be the last chapter.

Soon what has been written begins!
So that the good in the end wins.

While everyone despairs and evil grows.
Truth still hidden in poetry and prose.

The last awakening will take place.
A stray man comes out of the maze.

He is the one who knows everything.
Finally he awakes to the new sun king.

All the sneaky evil can only surrender.
And bow down in front of his splendour.
