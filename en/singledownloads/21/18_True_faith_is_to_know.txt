True faith is to know!

I feel this restlessness within me again.
Change is coming along with it, but when?

No information satisfies me anymore.
And especially not a boring game score.

The machine in front of me loses its effect.
None of the information is really correct.

I know the truth I find only in myself.
And also not in an outer bookshelf.

But the whole world wants to stop me.
And everyone would like to rob me.

This is my reality and I am a real creator!
I was once small but now I'll become greater!

I soon know every detail and the whole system!
So who could resist my light and wisdom?

When I wake up, the new time begins!
It will be a golden age without sins.

If someone else wakes up before, that's fine too!
We'll share the absolutely same point of view!

We will clean up here and end the grief!
We will revive together the true belief!
