To new heights!

Every poem is like a strong vibration.
Every poem creates an inner sensation.

Reading them makes your mind vibrate.
And positive thoughts are suddenly played.

Your oscillation is increased.
And old truths will be released.

In this way the world is changed!
And inner harmony is rearranged.

No one can stop this transition.
Poems spread a sacred cognition.

And if the vibration is high enough,
it will float up in the sky like a dove.
