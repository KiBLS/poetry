One-way road

I will succeed or die trying!
I'm so tired of all this lying.

I want and desire this change so much!
It's the holiest I wanna feel and touch.

Inside of me I feel so much vitality!
I wanna explore every of my ability.

I'd die slowly if I don't follow the call!
Even if I'm the one whos running against a wall.

I want to know and find out if it is true.
If I'm able to do what was done only by a few.

I'm going to cross every imaginary line!
And in the end the whole world will be mine.

I will accomplish what was prophesied!
And even if not, at least I have tried!
