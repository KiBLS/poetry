Bare truths

Prophecy and poetry join hands.
They spread easily in all lands.

Prophecies has always been poetic,
but poetry isn't necessarily prophetic.

The evil is considered good and honest.
Great liars are seen as the strongest.

But all the lies will soon come to an end.
The truth will become everyone's friend.

The day of change is drawing ever closer.
And it'll paves its sacred way like a dozer.

Nothing and nobody can stop the truth!
It comes merciless and yet very smooth.
