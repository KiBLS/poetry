Alternating seasons

Even if all good things seem lost.
And everything is covered with frost.

In winter the whole life retreats.
And there is hard ice on the streets.

But spring will always come back.
So don't paint everything so black!

Radiant warmth will bring new vitality.
The change of seasons is pure normality.

Every season has its own characteristics!
Independent of all unnecessary statistics!

Even if winter was very cold, spring comes.
Sometimes it sounds like miraculous drums.

So be sure, the change - it will arrive!
And everything will come back alive.
