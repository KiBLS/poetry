Internal freedom

Those who still believe in politics,
will be disappointed by sneaky tricks.

The eternal truth cannot be found there.
Because they never play honest and fair!

Bittersweet lies are served up again and again.
And in the end only cause even greater pain.

You'll find the solution only deep inside you!
And there is every truth, not just a few!

Forget the external distractions completely!
Deal with yourself intensively and concretely!

Question your thoughts and your true being.
And prepare yourself for your inner freeing.
