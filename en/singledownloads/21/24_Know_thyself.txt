Know thyself!

Above the entrance gate of the Temple of Apollo,
there is a sentence that everyone should follow!

It was written by the first of the seven sages.
And has been preserved through the ages.

He who finds and acknowledges its truth,
will find more than just eternal youth.

Those who seek the truth will find it sometime.
He'll be able to fathom the depth of every rhyme.

Nothing can stand in the way of this fact.
For he has seen through the eternal act.

Question all your actions and intentions!
To bring together all of the dimensions.

This is how true wisdom is renewed.
And the naked truth is simply viewed.
