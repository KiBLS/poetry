An unknown road

I have found the eternal light.
And thus ended my inner fight.

But how to go on - I have no idea!
But I know the solution is very near.

And thus I continue to go my way.
It would not be advisable to stay.

Every movement is only a deception.
Everything is created by my perception.

And yet - I'll walk and wait patiently.
In the end I'll accept the gift gratefully.

Whatever is waiting at the end of the path.
I'll walk full of confidence and without wrath.
