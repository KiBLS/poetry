Inner perception

The own consciousness is like an enigma.
Many think it's like an unwanted stigma.

They are afraid of their inner being.
They don't believe it's worth seeing.

But that's exactly where the solution is!
But it's also where all the pollution is.

He who's attentively exploring his awareness,
will find more than just inner fairness.

Doors will open that he never dreamed of.
And he'll suddenly discover eternal love.

Nothing could stop such a conscious entity.
For he has found his true and sacred identity.
