Real education

The truth stands without a protection.
But the lies don't know any connection.

A discussion is not a battle of swearwords!
And yet many choose these despised swords.

Uneducated people always insult others.
And never recognise their own brothers.

They are inwardly separated and divided.
By underhand lies and fear they are guided.

Only the more reasonable argument can win.
But rejection and ignorance are a real sin!

Clever people always let themselves be taught!
And again and again question each single thought.

The eternal truth makes you free deep within.
Only with it you can truly succeed and win.
