Your potential

Know thyself is the most essential!
In order to enable your full potential.

Question honestly all your intentions!
To remove all previous preventions.

Who are you and where are you going?
Just observe your own style of growing.

Your decisions were always right!
Your past reflects your might.

There is nothing right or wrong!
And neither weak nor strong!

There's only that which is eternal.
And that is your true kernel.
