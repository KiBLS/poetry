Extensive truthfulness

Your ego will be completely wiped out.
In this way something new can sprout.

Through constant scrutiny and observation.
You will experience a true transformation.

The veil of mist is completely dissolved.
And every bad illusion will be involved.

Your mind will be completely rearranged.
And thereby the whole world will be changed.

The old will make way for the new.
The false will go to create the true.

This change will not be easy of course.
But thus you will reach the true source.

There is a harmony between good and bad weather.
All is part of the whole and works together.
