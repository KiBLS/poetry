Controlled time

The consciousness changes its perception.
Thus originates the timeline deception.

Every single second the mind wanders.
This is how you can discover true wonders.

Every new moment creates a new illusion.
Deliberated time can be a real confusion.

All possibilities are already available.
Through your own mind they are scalable.

Your mind is the most powerful tool in existence!
It can easily overcome any time and distance.

Learn to see the entire image without rating!
Your true self will be the one you are dating.
