Smooth transitions

We are here and not a few.
We already know the true.

Go on telling your lies.
Go on with your disguise.

The lie thus breaks itself down.
The evil thus takes off its crown.

Truth is becoming increasingly strong.
The demise will not last for long.

What are a few years compared to eternity.
Truth in power is new sacred modernity.

The evil and deceitful will go.
And the good and kind will grow.
