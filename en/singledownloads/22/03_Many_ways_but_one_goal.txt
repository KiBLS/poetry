Many ways but one goal

I walk through an infinite maze.
I can no longer count the days.

Already gone so many wrong roads.
Thus carrying many unnecessary loads.

I have followed many hints in vain.
Yet energy flows through every vein.

I will some day find the real way out!
Because that is what this is all about.

Nothing and nobody will prevent this!
The real path and faith - I defend this.
