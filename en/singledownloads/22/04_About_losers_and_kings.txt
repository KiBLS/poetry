About losers and kings

The majority will simply bow down.
They'd accept the orders of every clown.

They don't know an own will or opinion.
They behave like a servile little minion.

They're the ones who want to be vaccinated.
From those cheeky lies they are fascinated.

They think vaccination is health and love.
And defend this lie with a boxing glove.

Evil propaganda shows its full force.
And heretically ignores the real source.

The majority gambled away their lives.
They'd even defend their ruin with knives.

Avoid the big cities and live apart.
Prepare yourself for a new start.

The nature will protect and hide you.
And your inner leader will guide you.

You won't lack for anything.
For you are going to be king!
