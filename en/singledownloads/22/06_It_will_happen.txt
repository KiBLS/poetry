It will happen

I'm still sitting in my room.
And watch this final doom.

I know I need to get out of here.
It's the call of nature that I hear.

Leave everything and just go.
To enjoy a much bigger show.

This world is your domain.
Go and begin your reign.

Soon the rapture begins.
To wash away all sins.

You have nothing to fear!
The hour of awakening is near.
