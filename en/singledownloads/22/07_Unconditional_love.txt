Unconditional love

Pure love is always unconditional,
in the past it was once traditional.

It makes no demands or stipulations.
It was once the basis of all relations.

It is fearless against all bad things.
It is able to spread its mighty wings.

You not only feel it, you really live it.
Broken hearts and souls - it revives it.

All fictitious boundaries are blurred.
And healing energies are transferred.
