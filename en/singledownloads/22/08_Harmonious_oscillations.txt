Harmonious oscillations

It's a satanic order that will soon fall.
At full throttle it crashes into the wall.

Unconscious decisions lead to the end.
Unlimited power is what they pretend.

But the change of time is now imminent.
Melodies resound from a sacred instrument.

Enchanting frequencies are played.
And negative vibrations will fade.

The world is now being transformed.
And the evil order is being stormed.

The change is becoming a true challenge.
But this is how everything will be balanced.
