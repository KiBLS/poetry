Self-empowerment

You're truly great from the toe to head.
Wherever you go you've always been led.

Every step you consider as mistake,
happened only to help you to awake.

Now open your eyes and start to see!
For your luck only you hold the key!

Your consciousness is the steering wheel.
It is able to destroy but also to heal.

You are the one who decides where it goes.
Your redemption is already very close.

Let your new journey now begin!
Because you are only here to win!
