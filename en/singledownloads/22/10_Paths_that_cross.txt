Paths that cross

Countless people now stand up.
Millions of lights now light up.

The earth trembles with delight.
About the greatest change I write.

The dark forces are now retreating.
The virtuous enjoy a grand meeting.

The bright ones are simply more.
And they are already at the door.

Nothing will tame or stop the masses.
A new cohesion of all classes.

For the first time everyone works together.
In order to finally beat the bad weather.
