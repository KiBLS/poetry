Contemporary history

I report from very crazy times.
Charity covers nowadays crimes.

Ignorance and confusion everywhere.
In the economy nobody plays fair.

One is forced to live at the expense of others.
One must constantly betray one's own brothers.

Whoever has enough money is right.
The poor man always loses his fight.

Ancient philanthropy is completely twisted.
And those who speak the truth will be listed.

We are on the brink of the greatest genocide.
But this time it will have effects nationwide.

Willing and ignorant biorobots obey,
until the bitter end they will stay.

But there is no going back from this stage.
These are the birth pangs of the new age.
