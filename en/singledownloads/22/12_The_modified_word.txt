The modified word

At the Council of Nicaea,
the Pope showed his Claw.

He falsified and replaced holy verses,
and thereby he did not get nervous.

Vegetarians became carnivores.
And so they started sacred wars.

The true word was heavily falsified.
And the real source was denied.

They adapted everything to their own needs.
And so they covered up cruel deeds.

But now the time of truth begins.
And so we uncover ancient sins.

Contradictions are uncovered.
And true faith is recovered.
