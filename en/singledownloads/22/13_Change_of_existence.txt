Change of existence

You feel insecure about the times?
Let me support you with a few rhymes!

You are not alone, we're the majority!
Together we are the true authority!

We are one and yet each one is unique,
and together we're everything but weak!

The eternal moment gives us power!
It will blossom like a beautiful flower.

The dandelion grows through concrete.
And thereby it breaks up the street.

The long-awaited change will be historic!
You have every reason to feel euphoric.

It seems like everything is going to break,
but everything is happening for us to awake.

The day we burst forth into the sunlight,
comes with the awareness of our true might.
