Verses for health

Sometimes poems write themselves automatically.
Verses just creates completely spontaneously.

There are times when I write so much,
each line can then trigger a deep touch.

But lack of oxygen and too much radiation,
can cause a strong and long stagnation.

Poisons and distractions also do their job.
and can lead in the end to a big flop.

Therefore I detox my own body every day,
and chlorine dioxide escorts me on my way.

I provide myself with the necessary nourishment.
In this way I achieve a complete refurbishment.

Zeolite removes the old waste toxins.
Thus I extend daily my health options.

He who eliminates waste from his own organism,
can also cure diseases like cancer and autism.

Modern diseases are caused by toxic substances.
Renounce them and use all possible chances!
