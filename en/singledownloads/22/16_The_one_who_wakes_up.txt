The one who wakes up

One who leads by setting a good example.
One who does not care about any scandal.

This one will be followed by the chosen ones.
Their actions and words are like sacred guns.

And when all rises up, the rest becomes active.
For the holy change will then be attractive.

The old chains will be shattered.
And the evil will be scattered.

We get to the root of the evil matter.
So that the good can make it better.
