A new teacher

I wait for the moment when I leave.
Until that day I will grow in belief.

The day when my new life begins.
The day I leave behind all my sins.

I want something new, something better.
That's why I'm writing this poetry letter.

Old things are renewed and replaced.
It fades away the targets I've chased.

On the horizon new values appear.
For my hazy past falls a last tear.

I've had the experience of enlightenment,
awakening is therefore my holy entitlement.

Today nothing seems still wrong or strange.
I've been heading always for that change.

Now my final goal is within reach.
And when I've reached it I'll teach.
