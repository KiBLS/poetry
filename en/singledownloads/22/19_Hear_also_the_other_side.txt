Hear also the other side

Audiatur et altera pars - is really important!
Because otherwise the truth is shortened.

Only those who acknowledge both sides can judge.
With contradictions you must come into touch.

Those who observe carefully will discover unity.
And they will not only recognise an opportunity.

Whoever realises the contrasts will understand,
how both sides are controlled and planned.

As times change, the sides become evident.
Obviously like a glasshouse standing elephant.

Those who recognise the signs of the times will see.
That everyone holds in his hand his own magic key.
