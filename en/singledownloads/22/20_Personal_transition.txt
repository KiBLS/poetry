Personal transition

Your own truth is what you have to discover,
in order to break through that cloud cover.

No one can walk in your shoes!
It's up to you the way you choose.

No one has followed your way for a week!
Therefore your view of things is unique!

You can try to teach it and explain it.
But it's difficult to grasp and name it.

Just start living your own veracity!
And explore all of your capacity.

The changing times are at hand.
And it truly changes each land.
