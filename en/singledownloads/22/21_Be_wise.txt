Be wise!

Sapere aude! Dare to be wise!
And start being one who flies.

Come out of your snail shell.
Free yourself from your cell!

Change now, these are new times!
Forget all the senseless crimes!

You are the one who can do it!
Your life can become a true hit.

Don't let others talk you down!
And recognise your own crown!
