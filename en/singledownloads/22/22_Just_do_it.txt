Just do it!

Conclude with the system,
that is the core of wisdom!

End contracts and addictions.
To start living your own fictions.

Dissolve illusory obligations.
And leave harmful Relations.

Your life is already waiting for you.
Your inner voice will never ignore you.

Walk from now your own trail!
That way you can never fail.

Consciousness reaches a higher stage,
this path will free you from your cage.

Ask your inner self for help and solutions,
that way you'll end all outer confusions.
