Break old patterns!

Most people act according to their conditioning.
And very rarely question their positioning.

After all, one has learned these things.
And this from "true scientific kings".

But we all need to question those illusions,
to expose these entrenched delusions.

And we should not ask another truth-broker,
lest we fall for the next practical joker.

Only in you can you find all the answers,
others call such people dream dancers.

Yet we are living the biggest dream right now!
And we are slowly seeing through it somehow.

When we all dream in a conscious way.
We will celebrate our true birthday.
