Tempting truth

A small spark can ignite a fire,
and a truth can expose a liar!

The eternal truth is glowing everywhere.
Only the lie claims it's complex and rare.

Just use your own mind and learn!
And thus create your inner turn.

Be a spark that lights the tinder.
Spit out the truth like a printer.

Use your own and inner wisdom to grow.
Just feel inside of you this endless flow.

Nothing stands in the way of your realisation.
For you are interacting with the sacred creation.
