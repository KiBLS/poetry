Happy new year?

Another year is coming to an end.
Unimaginable how we all have bent.

The next few years will become much harder.
But ultimately we will become much smarter.

Nothing like this should ever happen again.
Therefore, we're working on the end of the reign.

Self-governance is what we teach.
And in the end, that's what we'll reach.

Each of us must be aware of what we desire.
Go down with the majority or ascend higher.

Forget the future and the past.
For only this moment will forever last.
