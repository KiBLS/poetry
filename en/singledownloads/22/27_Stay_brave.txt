Stay brave!

Even though it'll be a tough year.
Go on your path without fear!

Don't let others get in your way.
Remember that this is a theatre play.

Nature wants to get to know you.
Your dream will soon come true.

Comprehensive knowledge and insight.
Your aura will shine very bright.

The brainwashing is coming to an end.
Get ready for your sacred ascent.
