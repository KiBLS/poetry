Now rise up!

I don't want to speak a wrong word.
I want to fly higher than a bird!

I want to achieve the unattainable.
I want to understand the unexplainable.

I want to break every imaginary limit.
And enjoy this with every minute.

I have kindled the fire within me.
I want to know what it brings me.

By spreading my sacred wings,
I'll surpass all previous kings.
