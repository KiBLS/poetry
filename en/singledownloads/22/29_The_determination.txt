The determination

I play with the words with ease.
Thus I have found my inner peace.

I revive sacred, neurolinguistic art.
Every verse comes deep from my heart.

What I write witnesses my personal evolution.
In me I have found every needed solution.

The outside world was only a single lie.
I saw it long time ago with my inner eye.

Soon I'll be able to act freely and live.
More and more wisdom is what I'll give.

A goal of which the majority only dreams.
This path and success rests in my genes.
