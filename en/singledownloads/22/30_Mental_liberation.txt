Mental liberation

Clarity prevails in my thoughts.
I've won where I've inwardly fought.

No one can fool me anymore.
The truth is what I stand for.

Only my dreams I will now pursue.
I'll separate the false from the true.

Imagination mixes soon with reality.
The positive change is what I see.

I go out only with the goal in mind.
What I was chasing for I'll find.

And when I have finally found,
I'll live in an eternal compound.
