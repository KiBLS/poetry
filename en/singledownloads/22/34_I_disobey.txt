I disobey!

I don't obey just because everyone says so.
If someone tells me what to do, I say no!

No one has permission to tell me what to do!
Even if they believe what they say is true.

To obey blindly always leads to sorrow!
So I ignore orders today and tomorrow!

I act on own responsibility and with care!
Nobody needs to tell me; how can you dare?

I must forever live with my decisions.
And for my life I have greater visions.
