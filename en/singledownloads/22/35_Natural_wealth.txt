Natural wealth

Leaving the system is unimaginable for many.
They would rather fight for the last penny.

And many would betray their own kind.
Even if their own ruin comes in behind.

But in order to finish this meaningless play,
you'll have to stop playing and go a new way.

Increase your knowledge and take the plunge!
Do not be concerned about your daily lunch.

Nature offers everything you need.
But it cannot satisfy all your greed!

Practice mindfulness and respectly.
In this way you behave correctly.

Tear out the root and it will no longer grow.
If you take something completely, start to re-sow.

In this way more and more is growing!
Wealth is created followed by true knowing.
