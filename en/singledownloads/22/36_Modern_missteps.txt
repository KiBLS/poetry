Modern missteps

The own time goes by very fast.
I can still remember the past.

I'm thinking of old values and ideologies.
And the emergence of new technologies.

A computer was something new.
How it worked I had no clue.

Colourful pics that you could control.
To reach in the end a certain goal.

The transition to the new digital age.
Soon turned out to be a beautiful cage.

How much I was fascinated by everything.
But above all I was a game score king.

How quickly I now look for the way out again.
To shatter this once so beloved chain.

No colourful images or numbers can hold me.
Even if it feels like I have sold me.

The exit to the real world is before my eyes.
In this way I'll escape from all virtual lies.

Alienated people seek the real reconnection.
They wanna feel true and sacred satisfaction.
