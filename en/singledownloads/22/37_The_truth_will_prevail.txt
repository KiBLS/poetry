The truth will prevail

In times of storm I am the calm,
and repeat the truth like a psalm.

In times when no one speaks, I speak.
Because I am not a submissive sneak.

In times when no one sees, I see.
I stand firmly rooted like a tree.

No lie can ever be strong enough.
I won't feign, even if times are tough.

I do not break in times of upheaval.
That is how I stand against da-evil.
