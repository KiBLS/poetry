The redaction

Looking for solutions to your issues?
And mind; are they generated by some news?

Or is it based on what others tell you?
Because you feel they have a similar view?

No one can ever know your own truth!
If you realize this, you can never lose.

The world outside is a single illusion!
Created by thoughts, it creates confusion.

But when the oppressive thoughts fall away.
Clarity is the only thing that will stay.

Then you will understand all the wisdom!
And you'll know ancient texts and symbolism.

Your role in the theater play will have ended.
And all previous limits will be transcended.
