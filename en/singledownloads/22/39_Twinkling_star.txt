Twinkling star!

You can see through everything.
That is the true way of a king.

You can live from your own light.
But for that, it must shine bright.

Things can move through thoughts.
This is how you connect the dots.

Do you want to starve in this society,
or experience nature in all its variety?

Raise your head and open your heart!
You're one and have never been apart.

You are the hero of your story!
So now rise up in all your glory!

Show the world who and what you are!
Just start to twinkle like a star!
