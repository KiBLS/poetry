Self Empowerment

Walk with your bare feet!
And learn what you can eat!

Separate yourself from dualities!
And respect all nationalities!

Plus and minus are one,
recognize it as pure fun!

Heat and cold are an illusion!
Poles often lead to confusion.

Explore your true center!
Listen to your inner mentor!

So no one can any longer fool you!
And no one can ever again rule you!
