The Toughest Choice

Should I go now or stay.
I only crave my own way.

This change is such a big step.
Far away from the World Wide Web.

I might miss some stuff.
And the path will be tough.

But if I think like this
and keep acting without bliss.

I will never get to run.
And never discover real fun.

So here and now i make an holy vow,
to walk from the realm of the golden sow.

To enter the world of truth and reality,
to find myself, my love and my sanity!
