A lie will always lose!

Even a well-meant lie remains a lie,
but hence the truth will never die!

The truth does not need to boast.
For it spreads from coast to coast.

Across the lands it will be recognized.
And only among liars It'll be despised.

An endless game to deceive the rival,
but it only works until truth's revival.

Now we all see an honest era coming again,
and this suddenly changes the evil reign.

When we recognize our counterpart again as friend,
then hope and truth rise and all deceptions end.
