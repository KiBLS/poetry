The required key

Over flowering meadows I want to walk.
About natural connections I want to talk.

I want to behold the eternal living.
Deep insights are what I am giving.

I'll recognise ancient natural foundations.
Valuable teaching pieces for new generations.

If I carefully listen, the nature will speak!
The trees, the wind, even the mountain peak.

You're connected to everything and not separate!
This all-embracing insight opens to you every gate.
