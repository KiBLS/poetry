Energetic change

No matter what you're doing,
now the holy storm is brewing.

You can already smell it in the air.
Such epochal changes are really rare.

No one will be anymore able to shirk.
On themselves everyone has to work!

It's an honour to live in these days.
The times when overlapping all pathways.

What a blessing to witness this time of change,
when goodness is stretching to maximum range.

Reach out and feel it like electricity.
the energy shifting with great elasticity.
