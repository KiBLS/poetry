Live according to your dreams

Please master tell me what to do!
Nothing was right from what I knew.

They lied to me and cheated.
And I always was mistreated.

Please give me a guide to my fortune!
Of everything I want a large portion.

Should I jump for it on one leg?
Or smash for you a fresh egg?

Please describe everything in detail.
So that I can no longer fail...

But I cannot tell you exactly what I wish.
I've never learned fishing, only how to buy a fish.

Is there an instruction manual for everyone?
And would my life in this way be at all fun?

Perhaps today i will choose to try,
to these gilded chains I'll say goodbye.

Now I see that I've always wanted more,
and to be my own master is worth any chore.

I'll choose my own path, to learn and to understand,
because kowtowing hurts my knee, heart, and hand.
