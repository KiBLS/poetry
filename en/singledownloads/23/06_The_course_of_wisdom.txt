The course of wisdom

One domino just knocks over the next.
Like one after another reads this text.

A single thought can be so strong,
that all stones in a line fall along!

Our thoughts and actions will spread,
by our visions and dreams we're led.

Dreams are realised piece by piece,
and thus doubts will greatly decrease.

Just like a small seed grows to become a plant.
And through the rain constantly gains a grant.

If one is looking ahead, one can easily see,
a wise drop changes the structure of the sea!
