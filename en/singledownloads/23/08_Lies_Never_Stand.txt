Lies Never Stand

A lie only needs to be repeated often enough,
but even then a duck cannot become a dove.

Propaganda is constantly played up and down,
so one can portray trashy people with a crown.

You can deceive many people for a long time!
But a squawk will never become a clear chime!

A theater game that so many play for a while.
But at some point you even lose the own smile.

Don't be discouraged, it is and remains a game!
To see through these lies should be your aim!

Over time, the lie will expose on its own.
Because the eternal truth was always known.
