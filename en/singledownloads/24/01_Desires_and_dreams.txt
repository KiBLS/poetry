Desires and dreams

You need not only a wish, but also desire!
This is how you'll ignite your inner fire!

What you desire, that will come to pass!
That's how you play in a higher class!

This game is very easy to understand.
It follows the rules of a dreamland!

Now connect all the existing dots,
and illuminate the latest dark spots.

And then when the darkness illuminates,
you'll discover by the light all the gates!
