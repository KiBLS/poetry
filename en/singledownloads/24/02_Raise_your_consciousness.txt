Raise your consciousness!

Holy verses were born in unholy times.
True wisdom hidden in discreet rhymes.

Pure neurolinguistic master signs,
are hidden in modern, digital lines.

My poetry work will soon be completed.
No further poems or wisdoms are needed.

Everything was described and explained.
The own mind was thereby retrained.

Now everyone can raise his consciousness,
and in the end recognize any commonness.

When the level of consciousness increases,
it will fit together all mysterious pieces.
