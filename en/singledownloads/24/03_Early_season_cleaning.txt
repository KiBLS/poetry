Early season cleaning

Nowadays burnt snow smells like plastic,
and that is not meant to be sarcastic.

Just like the rainwater is already polluted
because chemtrail slurry is added undiluted.

The air is full of dirt that we breathe.
And the earth is contaminated underneath.

Yet cleverly applied orgone cloudbusters,
can dissolve those dirty cloudclusters.

Effective microorganisms can enliven the ground.
And Mother Earth can play again a familiar sound.

We already have a solution for everything!
It's just up to us what we will bring in.

Start learning and continue your own education!
Together we can make the world a true sensation.

And once we all together become wise.
We've finally removed our old and hated ties.
