Stop complaining!

Grumbling and hypocrisy are in fashion.
Nowadays, many have found this a passion.

He who acts hypocritically also acts wrongly!
And feels inwardly torn and less strongly!

The one who is always only grumbling,
can often feel a strong humbling.

Search and find your inner peace!
And your contentment will increase.

Find within you what you're looking for!
In this way you will find more and more.

Understanding will grow and thrive!
And that will change your entire life!
