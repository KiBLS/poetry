Reprogramming

All my words can only be hints for you!
Only in yourself you will find the true!

Turn away from the outside and recognise!
You've always been all-knowing and wise!

Know yourself and begin to understand!
That you hold the destiny in your hand!

Colours are added to what was previously grey.
Therefore, it all had to happen this way!

Now recognise your true greatness!
In the midst of your own straightness.

Enlightenment followed by awakening!
The completion after the blackening.

The cycles have been overwritten.
For you nothing is longer forbidden!
