Conscious change

Everything that happens has a reason.
Just as nature needs every season!

All contradictions are united in you!
Everything old creates something new!

There is no reason for a fight!
For the day follows the night!

Outside you'll not find the solution!
Outside you'll only find the confusion!

The one who wanders through the ages,
is able to write sacred lines and pages.
