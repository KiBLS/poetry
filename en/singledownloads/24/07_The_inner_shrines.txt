The inner shrines

Don't let others take advantage of you!
Because no one can stand above you!

No one can understand your holy actions!
Just follow your path without distractions!

You've known the destination through all times!
It were described in so many of your rhymes.

Do your will, because it is right!
In this way you will shine bright!

Now it's time to take the final step,
and leave behind the world wide web.

You have left the most important traces!
So others can also find their inner places.
