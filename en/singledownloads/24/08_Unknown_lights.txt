Unknown lights

The wheel of fate turns relentlessly.
The sacred path is truly endlessly.

Now lead me to my highest frontiers,
Thus I will overcome all my fears!

I want to prove to myself what I can do.
Thus I want to create everything anew!

There'll be no struggle in this process.
Because I have the very supreme access.

Nothing and no one could ever stop me!
And also no one could ever drop me!

It goes on up to undreamed-of heights.
I'll discover all undiscovered lights.
