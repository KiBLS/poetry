Become free!

Constantly living in fear is not a good life!
It's like having at the own throat a sharp knife.

Constantly thinking you could do something wrong.
Makes you look anything but assertive and strong.

The delusion sits in one's own thoughts.
It is like a thread of life full of knots.

Free your thinking from external constraints.
This is what was done before by all the saints.

Only those who are free to believe and to think,
have the ability with "all that is" to be in sync.

No authority is above you or can command you!
And your own freedom no one can grant you.

So stop looking in the outside for a solution!
Start to live according to your own constitution!
