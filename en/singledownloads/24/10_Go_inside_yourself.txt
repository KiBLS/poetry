Go inside yourself

How can you go into yourself, do you know?
How could you help yourself to grow?

Should you have an x-ray or fluoroscopy?
Or learn something about spectroscopy?

Not at all! Start exploring your thoughts!
And recognise your consciousness spots.

You should do everything only by choice.
First you pay attention to your inner voice.

Write down what you think and what you feel!
And don't pretend that you are made of steel.

Every written sentence comes out of you!
And what comes out is nothing new.

Be as honest and profound as possible!
Reread it after a while and it'll be plausible.

Self-reflection is called the whole process.
And in the end this will lead you to success!

In this way, you project the inside out.
Thus you'll eliminate at the end any doubt.

Read your thoughts regularly and repeatedly.
Your own understanding will grow immediately.
