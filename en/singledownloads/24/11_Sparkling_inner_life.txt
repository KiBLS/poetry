Sparkling inner life

Free opinion is always a double-edged sword.
What is allowed and what is a forbidden word?

Who represents free opinion must swallow a lot!
And you've to accept lies that are really hot.

But when the truth shines through the own door,
nobody want to take those dirty lies anymore.

Because only the truth makes truly free.
And only it is liberating and the true key.

So question all nonsensical things and rules,
and start discovering genuine, sparkling jewels.

The only upright truth rests within you!
So the salvation has always been in you!
