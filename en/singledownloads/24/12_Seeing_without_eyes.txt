Seeing without eyes

We represent the divine in this game!
Our inner core was just set in flame.

So many tests have awaited us.
And pure success has created us.

You can see clearly even without eyes!
And without speaking you can destroy lies.

The world is simple and clear.
But the lie still rule by our fear.

We all have to awake our eternal mind.
But from authorities it'll be declined.

Know that we are telepathically connected.
That is what the evil have feared and expected.

Air is only an illusion and an appearance.
Water connects us and brings clearance.

That is why there are poisons and radiation.
They try to block the awakening in every nation.

What you could become is their main fear and reason.
Cause that will end this endless evil treason.
