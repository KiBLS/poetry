Leading by example

Even a small light illuminates the darkness,
and many together bring back the brightness.

Even as a small light you can grow and shine,
and at a certain point water converts into wine.

The more you go into yourself and seek,
the faster you'll reach the highest peak.

Our behavior and conduct will be a guide,
the truth is something we will never hide.

Break through boundaries and overcome fears.
This is how we pave the new way as pioneers.
