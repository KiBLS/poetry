Joint progress

Force cannot be fought with force.
That is a completely wrong course.

Eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth,
in this way everyone will only lose.

Devastating consequences one must know.
Rather, one's own understanding must grow.

Who kens himself can understand others,
and can truly treat them like brothers.

Discover inner peace - carry it outward!
That's how we can walk together forward!
