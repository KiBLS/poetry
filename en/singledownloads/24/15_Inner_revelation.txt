Inner revelation

The secret rests within you.
It's the eternal and the true.

Every contradiction will be resolved.
Because everything always evolved.

Know thyself - You are what is!
Realize that you are the bliss!

No one can step into your center.
For you are your own mentor!

Let the words work deep inside you.
It's the best help I can provide you!
