The melody of life

A consciousness rests in every living being.
this comprehension is part of the all-seeing.

Whether a human, a plant or an animal,
the sacred connection is not detachable.

Everything together flows in this stream.
Everything together results in this dream.

Where the dream ends, a new one begins.
A new tune is played on the piano strings.

Respect every life and live consciously!
Thus you can listen to a sacred melody.
