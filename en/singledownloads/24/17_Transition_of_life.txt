Transition of life

A caterpillar wraps itself in its cocoon.
To evocative afterwards a new tune.

After an assigned quiet time of dwell,
something new hatches from the shell.

A change that is outwardly surprising.
But only until its beauty is arising.

When the butterfly hatches and flies,
it's ready to soar to its new highs.

As a caterpillar, it only knew the ground.
By transition, it's freedom it has found.
