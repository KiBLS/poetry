The imaginary island

To be stranded on a deserted island,
where everything is natural and silent.

For many people, that would be a nightmare.
It's something that would give them a scare.

For me it would be an actualised dream.
Far away from any domination regime.

Doing what I want to do every day.
And for survival find my own way.

No one who condemns or patronizes one.
No one who does not begrudge me my fun.

I would be detached from any obligation.
I would truly live in my dream location.
