Mass awakening

In the past, we were divided into nations,
today, the division is on other foundations.

Today we are divided because of the attitude.
Every dissident the opponents will persecute.

He who speaks the truth needs a fast horse,
for he messes with a strong and dark force.

But when the light falls on the shadows,
the true change is already very close.

For blackguard can rule only for a short time.
But in the end it comes to light every crime.

No one can stop the awakening of the crowd.
No technology, no chips and no virtual cloud.

The day of awakening was always firmly written.
For the truth cannot forever remain hidden.
