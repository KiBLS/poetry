Turn of the tide

The most doctors keep the people sick.
And bankers make them poor by a trick.

Politicians are only telling fairy tales,
while "big pharma" increases its sales.

Food is poisoned and the water is impure.
And the truth they constantly obscure.

This world is really harsh and detrimental.
To his neighbor no one is honest or gentle.

But change comes after the great divide,
afterwards, it will turn finally the tide.

Even if the upcoming events will be hard.
Know that you're protected by an inner guard.
