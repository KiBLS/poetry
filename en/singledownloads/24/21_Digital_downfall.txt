Digital downfall

Man as part of the internet of things.
Thereby he is cheated out of his wings.

Genetically modified and manipulated.
Thus, externally his behavior is dictated.

Many believe it would be a protection.
But the body attacks itself as a reaction.

Deceived by the media and the politics.
They're following a path of apocalypse.

But apocalypse also means revelation,
it's needed for a new sacred foundation.

First everything will divide and split,
but in the end each part will fit.
