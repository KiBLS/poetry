Back to the roots

Let us create art that educates.
Art with the ability to open gates.

Art for the inner development.
Art that will become a testament.

Indispensable for a sacred change.
For many still completely strange.

But those who are aware will recognize.
Its taking place in front of all eyes.

Let's create art that changes everything!
Let's ride together toward this upswing.

And when we have raised our awareness,
we can play together again in fairness.
