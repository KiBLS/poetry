Withstand the temptation

The evil controls you through deep emotions,
to an outer chaos through inner commotions.

What you are attached to, it'll be utilized.
If you grasp the trick, you'd be surprised.

It is so simple and yet so insidious,
the techniques are absolutely heinous.

Therefore, you must control your feelings.
And you must discern the inner meanings.

Self-reflection is the true path to the goal.
It assembles all parts back into a whole.

Know thyself has always been everyone's task,
in order to thereby recognize one's own mask.

As a result, nothing will be able to affect you.
At that time, even the evil will respect you.
