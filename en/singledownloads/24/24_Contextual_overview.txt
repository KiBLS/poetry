Contextual overview

Life often pushes you down to the floor.
And often it still demands much more.

But when old chances and doors get closed,
new opportunities are suddenly composed.

To understand these hidden connections,
you've to consider all possible directions.

Look at the whole thing with more distance.
And free your mind from any resistance.

And even though you may not understand it,
trust that your destiny has planned it.

In retrospect, everything will fall into place.
And then you can put on again a happy face.
