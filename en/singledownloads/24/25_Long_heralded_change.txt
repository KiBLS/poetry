Long heralded change

All spirits and thoughts will be released,
that were once tied by a caste of the priest.

All these lies and confusions are exposed.
And the truly dark age will be finally closed.

What was always written will be consummated.
This inner change was long ago activated.

The evil will disintegrate themselve and fall.
Everyone will perceive the sacred freedom call.

Even if this game is going to last for a while.
And yet, soon we'll start to run the last mile.
