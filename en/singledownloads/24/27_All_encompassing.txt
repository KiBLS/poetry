All encompassing

Be aware - the alphilosophical view,
is something ancient and nothing new.

It embraces the whole beyond alchemy,
and it has nothing to do with blasphemy.

It integrates every aspect and detail.
And its power far exceeds any scale.

A holistic understanding fully centered.
In this way, a new dimension is entered.

Remind that every single thought and deed,
results in your right to fail or succeed.

One can say; what you sow, you will reap!
This wisdom is so true and also deep!

He who has sown bad will reap his sorrow!
The seed will sprout on a random morrow.
