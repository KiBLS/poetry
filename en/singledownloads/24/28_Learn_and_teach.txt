Learn and teach!

Learn how you can live independent!
So your aura becomes resplendent.

Learn to heal illnesses and to care.
And your knowledge you shall share.

True knowledge must never be sold!
For it cannot be weighed out in gold.

Making people suffer for a winning?
Against creation this is a sinning!

So share always your insights for free,
for inner growth this is an important key.

That way, everyone can become self-sufficient.
That way, everyone can become proficient.

You only have to discover your inner bravery.
Thus we will break the chains of slavery!
