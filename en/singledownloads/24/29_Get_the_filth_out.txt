Get the filth out!

The mystery of my poetic creativities,
are just my intense detox activities.

If I don't detox my body for a few days,
then there are blocked all creative ways.

How I do it is concealed in my verses.
That others can do it too is the purpose.

In my poems I pass on all my expertise,
so that at first glance - no one sees.

Whoever dives deeper will recognize a lot,
and find more wisdom than he had thought.

So detoxify your body and discover your mind.
And pass on that knowledge to all mankind.
