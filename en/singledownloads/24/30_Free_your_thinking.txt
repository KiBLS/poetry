Free your thinking

You just have to let everything go,
to recognize your own thought flow.

Everything grows only in your head!
Your self develops by thoughts you fed!

Free yourself from any outer desire!
And kindle within you a blazing fire.

When your worries suddenly fall away,
you can truly enjoy every single day.

When all your inhibitions disappear,
you can feel that everything is clear.

Take back the control of your own mind,
and it's gratification that you'll find.
