Discover freedom!

We are like gullible birds in cages,
we all were caged over eons of ages.

Genuine freedom - we did not know.
Before our eyes we enjoyed a show.

Our cages promised us good protection,
and we adored this shelter projection.

Suddenly everything begins to change,
cage doors open and that seems strange.

Now we notice the real world out there,
and we realize it's neither safe nor fair.

We'll receive no shelter or food any longer.
But self-responsible we will become stronger.

For outside is so much beauty to explore.
We just have to step out of the open door.

Dare you and leave these bars behind you!
Don't let any outdated lures blind you!
