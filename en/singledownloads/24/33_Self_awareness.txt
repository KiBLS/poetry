Self-awareness

Write down everything that is burdening you.
This is how you create a perceptive view.

Just write all your problems off your chest.
In the process, be honest and give your best!

Your inner thoughts are projected outward,
This is how you go step by step forward.

The whole process is called self-reflection.
So know thyself and get out of the deception.

Read it, improve it, and keep on to reflect.
And keep going even if it appears suspect.

Who knows himself becomes self-confident,
and thus can walk his path with competence.

No one can ever seduce or lie to you anymore!
On this way you open the most important door!
