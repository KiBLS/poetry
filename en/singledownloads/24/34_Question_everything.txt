Question everything!

The things that are the most criticized,
must always be most carefully analyzed!

Scrutinize profoundly every public claim,
and with "hidden truths" - do the same!

For he who once has heard every lie,
can detect the truth with his own eye.

He doesn't have to ask others anymore,
because he has found the truthful core.

So embark on the journey through the lies.
And become someone who is truly wise.
