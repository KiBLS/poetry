Call of nature

Stinging nettle is the best plant for survival.
In this area, the plant has only a few rivals.

It has many proteins and is rich in nutrition.
Also as a medicinal plant it fulfills a mission.

It is useful like hemp but grows like weed.
And it spreads everywhere with a high speed.

But also dandelion and daisies are digestible.
In nature, this is all free of charge testable.

Also many of the known tree leaves are edible.
Anyone who learns this finds it is incredible.

There are also mushrooms and medicinal plants.
It takes not much time until one understands.

Everything grows for free and without fees!
Therefore, you can feed yourself with ease.

From fertilized fields or natural forest floor,
what is healthier and what could you want more?

The nature serves not only emergency food,
it also provides health and a better mood.

Start exploring it now before it is too late!
Follow the path of wisdom to fulfill your fate.
