Getting Ready to Evolve

Listen carefully to the voice of your soul,
it possesses the true meaning of the whole.

Pay attention to the signs around you,
all of them are hints that surround you.

Start to question honestly every feeling,
that way you'll recognize its true meaning.

Don't allow that your demons guide you.
Scrutinize the dark shadows inside you.

Now make amends with your shadow,
walk by its side and use it to grow.

Like good friends who forget their old grief,
and find their inner light and renewed belief.
