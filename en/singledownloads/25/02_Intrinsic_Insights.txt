Intrinsic Insights

Falsified truths resemble a lie!
Not detectable with the naked eye.

Even the mind has problems with it,
who keep it calm can deal better with it.

True wisdom is always sharp as a blade,
but a lie can never reach such a state.

Your truth is the mark of your existence.
No lie is capable to offer it resistance.

So go into yourself and realize who you are!
In that way you're able to heal every scar!
