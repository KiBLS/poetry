The maze of Existence

In the hopelessness our valour shall shine.
Courage shall rise with every written line.

In times when all seems lost our hearts will glow.
In the middle of decay something new will grow.

Remember that every nightmare has its own ending.
Overcome your fears for a renewed understanding.

From fading memories something new is born!
Just as a young plant grows out from the corn.
