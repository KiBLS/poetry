Future Message of a Histographer

All the thoughts were suddenly liberated.
Hereby, the sacred cores of man were located.

Everyone recognized his own light right away.
It became colorful what was once gray.

Everyone started to feel their inner might.
For the seed of courage grew in their mind.

As a serpent of fire that flows upwards,
motivated and enlivened by such words.

And suddenly all the chains were broken,
at the moment when the truth was spoken.
