Energetic explosion

In such truly dark times you must shine,
in order to experience your own divine.

When all poles are twisted and reversed,
you've to set the example as the first!

For the truth you will be attacked.
But a sacred core can't be cracked.

For the truth you will soon be persecuted.
By a twisted truth innocents are executed.

But no matter how dark the times may seem.
Just keep on holding on to your dream!

The contradictions will come back in balance,
thus you'll achieve an important advance.

All of your energy will be suddenly released,
so you'll feel that your frequency has increased.
