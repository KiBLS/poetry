You are...

You're what is and what always remains.
One who puts on but also breaks chains.

You're what was and what remains eternal.
The one who has discovered his kernel.

You're the calm and the strength in a storm.
Like all elements reborn in a human form.

You're wonderful from your head to your toes,
Like a beacon that constantly grows.

Your body holds the heaven as well as hell.
Like a master key through your own spell.

You're what often ends and re-begins.
One of many who loses but also wins.

You're the light at the end of a maze.
Like one who can choose many ways.
