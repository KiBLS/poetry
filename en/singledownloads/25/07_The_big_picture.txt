The big picture

We are truly a common collective.
Each one with a unique perspective.

Different characteristics and ideas.
Different preferences and also fears.

What also differs are our perspectives.
And as a result of that, our objectives.

Our stories only seem to run separately,
in fact, many elements form a complexity.

All these stories together form an entity.
In which you play a role as an identity.

So we all add more colors to the whole.
And each individual thereby plays its role.
