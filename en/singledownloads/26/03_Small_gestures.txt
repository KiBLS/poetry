Small gestures

I want my words to spread,
on all social media sites.

That's why I remove any copy protection,
and let the fate run free.

Spread my wisdom where you want,
it's the development you're helping.

I do not attach importance to fame and honor!
Because it is the change that I teach.

The financial system - it will go down!
Blinded people will see again!

So long so much suffering was produced,
and true misery simply accepted.

But there everything would be also free of charge,
what you need, falls into your lap!

Colored notes and virtual numbers,
produce nothing but imaginary agonies!

Let go of all the propagated lies,
and what was once small then becomes big!
