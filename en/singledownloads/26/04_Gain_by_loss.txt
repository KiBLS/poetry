Gain by loss

Refusal to vaccinate is severely penalized.
By this, the people will soon be surprised.

Do you've enough to refuse the vaccination?
Do you've enough for more than one negation?

The solution takes you out of this system.
For this you will need a profound wisdom.

You will lose your house, car and reputation.
And you must resist every material temptation.

On the one hand, there is the biggest loss.
But you gain through it your inner gloss.

For he who owns nothing owns everything.
And out of a beggar then becomes a king.
