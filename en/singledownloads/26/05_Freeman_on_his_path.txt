Freeman on his path

I have no fixed place of residence.
The world is my place of existence.

I don't need an ID card or passport.
Cause the entire world is my resort.

I don't pay any taxes or contributions.
Cause all these are worldly delusions.

I do not use money or a bank account.
Nature provides me a special discount.

I am not registered or reported anywhere,
I have and own only the things that I wear.

I wander to many different places.
And there I leave my personal traces.

My creativity is expressed in the spirit.
And so I write the most intense lyrik.
