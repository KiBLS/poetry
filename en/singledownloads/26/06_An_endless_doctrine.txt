An endless doctrine

The noose is slowly being tightened,
and ever more people are frightened.

They do not believe what they can see,
because everything develops just crazy.

Many people feel reminded of the past,
they thought these times had passed.

But history is an uninterrupted process,
even if tales appeared once like a success.

But the winner always embellished the history,
thus many contradictions remained a mystery.

Now the time of revelation is drawing near.
And many can already feel a gnawing fear.

The evil will very soon lift its herded veil.
But this time it'll surpass its former scale.

As long as money rules, history will be repeated.
But the day is near when evil will be defeated.
