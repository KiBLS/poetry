Choose your words wisely

There is good but also bad word magic,
They convey the best or the most tragic.

While many often talk thoughtlessly,
they do not conduct very cautiously.

All our words are like magic phrases,
Everywhere they leave their own traces.

Formed from thoughts, they are effective,
They can even steer a whole collective.

Spells that germinate like many seeds,
and out of them are born the deeds.

Who recognizes the wisdom and its way,
knows about the significance of the array.

Everything was always interconnected.
Through interplay, everyone is affected.
