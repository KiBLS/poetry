Known goal, unknown path

Society can no longer offer me anything,
for I am in search of the title of a king.

I only trust my own wisdom and guidance,
because I have found this inner silence.

I have looked into the eye of all that is.
For a long time it was for me like a quiz.

I'm ready to end this boring Monopoly game,
and start to do for what I've finally came.

The time of the departure is drawing near.
I am now ready to take over and to steer.

No matter how arduous this journey may be.
In the end, I'll finally wake up and see.
