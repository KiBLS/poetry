Awakening after enlightenment

I would like to awaken with all my heart.
I want to ignite the fire within me.

It will just happen without compulsion.
That's why I can't understand it.

Just stay right here in the moment.
Don't drink alcohol or beer.

Go out into nature to connect,
Then you will soon find your goal.

Always live without fear and without compulsion.
The time is then irrelevant.

Creation knows what you are striving for.
It does not matter how you live.

The process is already in full swing.
But nothing grows with the help of tongs.
