Those hidden gates

Completely blinded and deluded,
living in a world that is polluted.

Unsuspecting like a small child.
Thoughts run around like wild.

So much useless talk everywhere.
Genuine wisdom seems really rare.

Everything is just a distraction.
So far away from any satisfaction.

But the upheaval has already begun.
By the long prophesied black sun.

Ancient facts have been distorted.
And liars were too much rewarded.

But when the holy light again radiates,
it will once more open unimagined gates.
