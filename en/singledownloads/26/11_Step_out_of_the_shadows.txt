Step out of the shadows

The true path leads through a dark place.
For it's your own darkness you must face.

Your own madness becomes more and more.
Those innermost fears come to the fore.

One would love to despair and give up.
But it must go on to the point of breakup.

Keep always in mind it's only an illusion.
Born out of confused ideas and a delusion.

When every delusion is thought through,
you will be able to recognise the true.

It's like a liberation, a true salvation.
For your new beginning it's a foundation.

When incorrect programming just crashes.
Something new rises from its old ashes.
