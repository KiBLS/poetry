Realize and awaken!

What you are afraid of, it manifests.
It's one of the greatest life tests.

Who recognizes how he is controlled,
holds a key more valuable than gold.

Recognize all the illusionary fears.
Even if it'll cost you several tears.

The valley of fears you must now leave!
Thereby you'll discard an outer sleeve.

Just as the butterfly will suddenly awake.
Is it the futile mind that you'll shake.

The awakening will take place in its own time.
And the sacred outcome will be truly prime!
