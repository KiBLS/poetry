Sounds of change

The infinite sends a greeting,
it waits for the major meeting.

It has always been just there,
at any time and everywhere.

Ready to be finally recognized,
is it for everyone centralized.

You have to open your inner eye,
and the old world will say goodbye.

Something new will be birthed.
It dissapears what was cursed.

The old goes and the new comes.
You can already hear the drums.

Everyone will witness the shift!
It'll be the most cherished gift!
