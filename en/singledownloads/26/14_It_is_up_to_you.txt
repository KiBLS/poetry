It is up to you!

Continue to haggle with health?
Or find comprehensive wealth.

Continue to fight for dirty cash?
Or weather the financial crash.

Continue to play hateful war?
Or discover the eternal core.

Continue to follow the news?
Or start to win instead of lose.

Continue to do as before?
Or try to open a new door?

Every choice is up to you alone!
You've to stride it on your own.
