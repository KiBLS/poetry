Light your fire

Heavily blinded and dumbed down.
Countless brain cells killed.

Poisoned, stunned and letargic.
Weak is what once was strong.

But a spark was kindled.
It was delivered from afar.

Its value cannot be measured.
It has long been considered as forgotten.

It hits dried up tinder.
The kindling works true miracles.

Nothing can stop it from flaring up.
Nothing will diminish this ember.

Everything inferior will melt away.
For a new king will be chosen.
