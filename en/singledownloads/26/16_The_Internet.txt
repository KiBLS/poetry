The Internet

The Internet is like an addiction!
From reality - an escape.

Virtual images and animations
create confused visions in the mind.

Around the clock there are news,
from true delights to dark sufferings.

Propaganda to control people,
news to fire up the neurons.

The offline world seems to be forgotten,
because people are obsessed with the virtual.

Many could no longer live without it,
They say to themselves; that's just the way it is today.

But the real world, it offers more!
And the real change comes closer and closer.
