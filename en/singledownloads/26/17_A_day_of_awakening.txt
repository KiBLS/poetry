A day of awakening

Whether the best friend and the worst enemy,
you're connected to all of them - mentally.

Everyone will soon realize; we are all one.
Then the sacred change will be finally done.

Everyone carries his own part of the whole.
To - know thyself - is everyone's goal.

Those who grasp unity cannot act otherwise.
He sees the whole world with different eyes.

Any separation was always only an illusion,
but it lasts not forever - that confusion.

Everybody will realize the unity one day.
And then we will all follow the same way.
