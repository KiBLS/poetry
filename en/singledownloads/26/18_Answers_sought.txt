Answers sought

Where will my journey take me?
Will that holy light awake me?

Am I just one among billions?
Am I just a lonely existence?

So many teachers were present.
They all shared the wisdom scent.

What I do seems so easy to me.
But am I carrying "that key"?

Honestly, I already know the answer.
Because I am a real dreamdancer.

But which place in life shall I take?
How to know that I am not a fake?

When I know the answer and feel it,
are there still reasons to conceal it?

So many questions that still arise,
but who seeks the answer becomes wise.
