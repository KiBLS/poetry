External deities

Worshiping something external is psychopathy,
for ignorance and blind faith are an anomaly.

Only those who know themselves are blessed.
Since he recognizes what beats in his chest.

Many people will awake shocked at the end.
Because they have betrayed their best friend.

Who believes the external fakes and lies,
is sightless and blinded on both eyes.

The one who does not decide has already decided,
he continues to serve mammon and is misguided.

Only very few will break free from the controls,
and even fewer will thereby keep their souls.

Truly hard times are running fast ahead of us.
It is nothing that we need to deny or discuss.

Do you want to be independent or dependent?
Do you want to swim in the current or ascend?

Everyone will have to discover it on his own.
Do you want to be free or become a drone?
