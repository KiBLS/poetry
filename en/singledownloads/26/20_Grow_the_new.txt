Grow the new!

Will it ever be like it used to be?
The past with its illusionary beauty?

Live carefree and without sorrow.
Just live the day until tomorrow?

Meet new people and be curious?
Feel unfamiliar and be hilarious?

Nothing will ever be the same again.
For you've walked through the pain.

From now on, something new will emerge.
Everything old fell victim to the purge.

Now it is up to you what you create.
Follow the intellect or your fate.

Create something worse or improve it.
You're the only one who can approve it.

May your most ardent wishes come true!
By creating out of the old everything anew.
