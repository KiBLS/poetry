Natural wake up

I want to see it with my own eyes.
I want to describe what I recognize.

I want to sleep under the open sky.
And wonder there about the why.

I want to observe the pure nature.
Watching that flowing portraiture.

I want to be free from all ties.
And thus sort out all those lies.

Illumination is something elusive,
but awakening is truly exclusive.

So I leave everything old behind,
to finally free my eternal mind.
