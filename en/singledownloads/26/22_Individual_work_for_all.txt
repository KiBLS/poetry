Individual work for all

The whole works together in detail.
Together we experience a fairy tale.

Go your way, find your inner peace.
In your interest make it increase.

You yourself can give it a birth.
Each of us creates heaven on earth.

Everyone is a part of the whole.
Know thyself was always the goal.

Spiritual work is everyone's task.
To take off any imaginary mask.

And when each role was resolved.
Will we all as a whole have evolved.
