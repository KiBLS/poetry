From inside out

Question everything you have done so far.
Always ask yourself who you really are.

If you want to make a positive move,
you have it for yourself to approve.

If you really want something to change,
just do it... does it sounds strange?

No one can take that task from you.
when you see it - create it all anew.

No external authority can prevent it.
The inner change, you'll represent it.

The true change happens only inside!
And from there comes the only guide.

Finally you will bring the inside out.
And of that you can be really proud.
