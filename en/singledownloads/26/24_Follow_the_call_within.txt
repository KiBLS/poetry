Follow the call within

Only you yourself can take back your liberty,
and release yourself from your own captivity.

You don't have to ask anyone for permission.
This is a difficult but important cognition.

The whole thing was always a mental jail,
before one's own eyes - it's like a veil.

If you look behind the curtain, you'll see.
It'll open up a sacred world of eternity.

Everything is right now, in this instant.
Every detail was always here and existent.

The moment when your own perception widens,
then you're followed the holiest guidance.
