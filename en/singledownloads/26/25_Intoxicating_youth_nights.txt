Intoxicating youth nights

I want to feel the bass again,
spray my happy hormones.

To feel vibrating resonances,
through totally ecstatic dancing.

Want to forget all my worries,
lose myself in all the bass.

To get high and intoxicated.
Listen to the sounds on ecstasy.

Enjoy the illusion of happiness.
Shoot the mind into other worlds.

What were those crazy times?
I only remember the details.

My life was completely carefree.
Very worth experiencing from my point of view.
