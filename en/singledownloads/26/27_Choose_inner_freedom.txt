Choose inner freedom!

Whether you should vote blue or yellow.
Whoever fakes a choice isn't a good fellow.

No person could ever force me to consent,
It is a point of how much I could not bend.

If I am forced to choose the option a or b.
Then I choose the number one hundred three.

First it sounds crazy but it's your own choice.
Don't choose but give your inner self a voice.

Choose what you yourself set as a possibility,
and draw your innermost thereby into visibility.

True change has always come from deep within.
So show the world the inside and start to win!
