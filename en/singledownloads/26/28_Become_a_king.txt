Become a king!

Nothing is out of your reach!
This fact is worth to preach!

Nothing is ever impossible!
Your thoughts are unstoppable!

Whatever you can conceive,
you can also easily achieve!

Think it, feel it, envision it.
And the fate will position it.

Then it's up to you to access.
Then you'll feel inner success.

But never satisfy your greed!
For this everyone must bleed.

If you don't want deceptions,
be aware of all connections.

You're linked with everything,
so think and act like a king!
