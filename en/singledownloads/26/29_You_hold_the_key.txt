You hold the key!

What should a new future look...?
Do you already have an overlook?

Begin and let your mind wander.
And start deeply to ponder.

Do you desire the transhumanism?
Or do you reject such a schism?

The division of body and mind?
and the total control behind?

Well, if you're not aiming for it,
Reshape your mind and explore it.

Don't deal 24/7 with that insanity.
Think how you imagine humanity!

How do you plan the futured live?
Do you want to flourish or survive?

Realize your own spiritual potential!
For a positive change, this is essential.

Do you want to be dominated or free?
You hold in your hand for both the key.
