Ignite and shine!

Start to project the inner outward.
Even if it first sounds awkward.

Show the world that you're there,
and that you sincerely care!

From deep within comes the word!
So let your thoughts be heard!

Without your thoughts, others rule,
and they believe you are a fool.

For they could not even suspect,
what a pure mind could project.

For the stupid, it's all stupid talk.
They've no idea how wrong they walk.

So start to ignite your bonfires!
And expose all those ignorant liars.
