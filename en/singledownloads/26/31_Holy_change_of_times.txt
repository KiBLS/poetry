Holy change of times

Not a single poem I know by heart,
although it is my very own art.

But all the knowledge is in me.
I am full of ideas, like a sea.

I serve myself as much as I want,
and thereby I feel like a savant.

But often I am myself very amazed.
About wisdoms that I have raised.

I could do this all life long.
But time plays a different song.

We are in times of transition.
Knowing yourself is the mission.

Who knows himself will be a winner.
And thereby recognize every sinner.

Sacred lines are hidden in rhymes.
To recognize the present times!
