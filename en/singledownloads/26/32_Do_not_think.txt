Do not think!

It is the middle of the night.
At this time I love to write.

I just turn off my own intellect.
Thereby nothing I would expect.

I am living in the present moment.
Thus I can live a real bestowment.

I don't ponder for long, it just flows.
That is the secret of how it goes.

Emptiness of thought is fulfillment.
For it encompasses every brilliance.

Everything arises from the silence.
Without any kind of inner violence.

Become creative and experience it.
Thus you'll write a serious hit.
