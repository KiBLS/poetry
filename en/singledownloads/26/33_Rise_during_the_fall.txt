Rise during the fall

At the point of despair, they draw power.
They feel ringing the most important hour.

When there is no longer any faith or hope,
out of nowhere new paths suddenly develop.

When the situation seems to be worn...
In the greatest need those heroes are born.

They can't help themselves but simply act.
Their actions have the greatest impact.

But this point is far from being reached.
Because they are still hidden and teached.

But when these sacred times gain maturity,
such heroes awaken in strength and purity.
