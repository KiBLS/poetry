Your personal lesson

Now it is time to become self-aware!
And thereby learn to heal every scar.

He who rises high can fall very deep.
And he who is awake does not sleep.

He who stands still does not get ahead.
And he who is alive is still not dead.

There is no shadow without the light!
Without depth there'd be no height.

Your perception defines where you stand.
All that exists is your personal brand.

All that happened had to happen that way.
Just as the night is followed by the day.

There is no suffering without a cause.
Only an important lesson that it was.

And the souls who've passed the test.
They may also experience the rest.
