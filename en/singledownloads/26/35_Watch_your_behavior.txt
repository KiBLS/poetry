Watch your behavior!

Genetically modified plants can be patented.
Genetically modified humans are now invented.

What cannot be patented is natural biology.
This is why they create an artificial ethnology.

Your own voluntary consent will be required.
Because your complete submission is desired.

Implied action is a tacit declaration of intent.
By your actions, they'll obtain your consent.

When you get on a bus, you agree to its rules.
You don't have to study to understand this tool.

By taking a drug, you agree to the side effects.
Because the unanticipated effects are complex.

Do you abide by their rules? Do what they say?
Then you tacitly agree to the diabolical way.

Who wants to use the system, gives his declaration.
And he must also accept the strange dictation.

They are perfidious games that they're playing.
And it's your life with which you'll be paying.

Be aware that the d-evil never plays ever fair!
This is how they try to lure you into a snare.

Conscious denial is necessary to explain the will.
This is the only way to express a negating skill.

Be ware who you're supporting through your actions.
For thereby you call possibly unimagined reactions.
