Know who you are!

Is God in you, with you, or outside of you?
Is he beside you, under you, or above you?

Is he an external entity, from you separated?
Or does he've love and energy in you created?

Is he only in you or in your neighbor as well?
Is he something you can buy or even sell?

If everything is a unity, is he a disunity?
Is he a thinking being or part of any community?

When everything is connected is he disconnected?
Such questions aren't supposed to be reflected!

He who must think can not act timeless.
True knowledge is dynamic and never aimless.

Because the conclusion you come to is heretical,
and opens potential that resonates prophetical.

But heretical only from what point of view?
For church authorities don't stand for the true.

The true is within you, you are and embody it!
And no one could ever replicate or copy it.

Recognize who and what you are right now!
It's you through thoughts who always sow.

Everything divided forms together a whole!
To recognize the true is everyone's goal.
