Outbreak

Listening to music? Go dancing?
Or get your own house financing?

Buy a car? Or an electric bike?
Go for a short walk or a hike?

Pay bills and increase my money?
Or just eat a bread with honey?

Listening to new lies from radio or TV?
Or taking a nice cruise across the sea?

Consume more trash from the Internet?
Or think about virtual people I've met.

It is all so bleak in this society.
Everything I see is full of irony.

Nothing satisfies me in the long run,
and things around me makes no more fun.

I want to go out into the countryside!
I want to follow only my inner guide!

I want to discover the peace within me!
And see what this miracle can bring me!

I want to feel independence and liberty!
I want to feel the true life and infinity!
