Sarcastic lines

Brand new armoured police cars.
And Corona deniers behind bars.

So many fancy new uniforms.
And well thought-out new norms.

New vaccines at random.
Enjoying a large fandom.

So many smart people around.
Big Pharma will be crowned.

Others take over the thinking.
And much propaganda for linking.

The brave new world is on the march.
And spreads under the sacred arch.
