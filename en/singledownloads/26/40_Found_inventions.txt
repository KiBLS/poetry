Found inventions

Nobody could ever invent anything.
He only discovered a causal string.

He recognized a hidden mode of operation.
Already existing things in a new formation.

For "that which is" has always been present.
But prior it was a well concealed content.

Whether stacking stones to build a tower,
or even a clockwork to read the hour.

There is nothing new only "all that is",
our spirit creates out of it a doom or bliss.

From everything that is, we split a part,
and then we call it mental or manual art.
