About lies and propaganda

Should i hate now the muslims or the jews?
Should I be afraid of chinese due the news?

Should I believe waste is just like organic?
Or what should I do to keep my growing panic?

Should I be now afraid of a fake pandemic?
Or should I submit to the entire polemic?

Be afraid that chlorine dioxide will kill me?
Or that the 5G radiation will slowly grill me?

You have to question so much these days.
But after the lies, only the truth stays.

All division has no meaning and is injurious.
What comes out at the end can be curious.

Whoever believes others is controlled.
And thereby his soul has been sold.

Only who calls own experience his own.
Is able to stand firmer than any stone.

His charisma becomes increasingly powerful.
As a result, his life becomes more colorful.

Do not be guided by all the external lies.
Trust only your experience and your eyes!
