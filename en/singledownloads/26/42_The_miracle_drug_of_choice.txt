The miracle drug of choice

I tell once more about chlorine dioxide.
It's the best miracle cure I've ever tried.

By propaganda of lies they try to denigrate it.
But in public they do not want to debate it.

They always make a big scandal out of it.
And convince only those who anyway doubted it.

They compare it with caustic toxin and bleach.
And claim it would be bad what you could reach.

But no one ever tried it - out of sheer fear.
They believe what the news says is totally clear.

Imagine a remedy that cures almost anything.
And without cost, it's health that it'll bring.

Would big pharma support something like that?
Or would they demonize it like a black cat?

Who buys advertising in the normal medias?
And do they fake nowadays encyclopedias?

Whoever exposes the lies will find salvation.
And he will experience a health sensation.

Used correctly, you think you're in wonderland.
Because health and sanity walk by your hand.
