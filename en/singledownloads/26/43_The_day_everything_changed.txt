The day everything changed

It became a special day for everyone.
For on this day the good really won.

Colorful papers with which they lured.
Thus, the evil rule was long secured.

When virtual numbers lost their appeal,
and all people recognized what was real.

When no one could be influenced anymore,
when no one sold himself like a whore.

At that time, everything suddenly changed.
And everything was spiritually rearranged.

The morphogenetic field transmitted the data.
The consciousness became wiser and greater.

No one went to war to kill others anymore.
Everyone recognized in the other a holy core.

All diseases were cured by all together.
As a result, everyone became clever.

After all, money no longer played a role.
Thus we realized a long forbidden goal.

We all worked together on our well-being.
And we realized our unity as the All-Seeing.
