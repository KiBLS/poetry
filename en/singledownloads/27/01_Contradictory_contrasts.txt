Contradictory contrasts

In the beginning, you're led down the wrong ways.
And you're taught that it's mammon you must chase.

But in the course of your life you may realize.
That the truth on the outside is full of lies.

Some will never see through the deception.
Because they're blinded in their perception.

But whoever seeks the redeeming will find.
For he who wants to see will not remain blind.

That which is cryptic becomes soon apparent.
For that which was opaque becomes transparent.

And so the long search will come to an end.
And that which once fell will again ascend.
