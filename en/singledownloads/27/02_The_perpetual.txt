The perpetual

The end becomes just a new beginning.
During the downfall, you are winning.

While the old gradually fades away,
It's the new that will grow and stay.

When the seed passes, a plant grows.
Wisdom comes when the ignorance goes.

All knowledge is already within you.
You just have to discover it anew.

You are what is. You are the eternal.
You've an indomitable, sacred kernel.

The outside world comes from within.
It's that which has at all times been.
