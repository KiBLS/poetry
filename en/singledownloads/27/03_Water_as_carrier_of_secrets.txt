Water as carrier of secrets

It's not the only thing that connects us.
There are also frequencies that affect us.

But one secret is the humidity of the air,
connected with the water that you wear.

For the most part, you are made of water.
To be precise, three parts of a quarter.

A portion of air is also inside the ocean.
All that water is constantly in motion.

So no matter if you are poor or wealthy,
water keeps everyone alive and healthy.

And no matter if you are big or small.
The sacred water just connects us all.

Recognize the liquid connection to arise.
That knowledge are insights of the wise.
