Inconspicuous sweet poison

Sugar is a very poisonous food.
It not only affects your mood.

It is as addictive as cocaine,
you'll need it again and again.

It is mixed in almost everywhere.
Not teaching about it is not fair.

A deficiency causes depressions.
In the worst case also aggressions.

Always watch what is in your food!
That your health can be renewed.

Detoxify from those toxic compounds.
So you also lastingly lose pounds.

Sugar is a bitter sweet temptation.
Without it you'll enjoy a sensation.
