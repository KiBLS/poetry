Change that what is

It's a tremendous change that has to come.
But honestly; where should it come from?

Can the future actually be changed?
Can ongoing processes be rearranged?

You can never change someone else.
Only you can truly change yourself.

Thereby you deprive you of outside forces.
And so you can redetermine your courses.

As a shining example, you'll lead the way.
Unconcerned by what others think or say.

Self-responsibility is your redemptive key.
Possibilities as countless as drops in a sea.

You can do what you really want to do.
Along the way you will realize the true.

Free yourself from your old chains,
and release yourself from old pains.

Your own chains can only be broken by you!
Liberated you can create everything anew.
