The day when the auras shine

The mentally dead people are walking around.
The walking dead have big pharma crowned.

They want a new injection all the time.
And would give away for it the last dime.

Fake security against a fantasy pandemic.
Mentally retarded they love the own polemic.

But the gene therapy will cause them to die.
And the whole besotted society will wonder why.

Viral mutants will be their pretextual answer.
More people will die from it than from cancer.

It is a disguised modern population control,
where the media play their diabolical role.

It is the biggest genocide in our history.
Remains for the majority a true mystery.

The day when control ceases is drawing near.
The day when the chosen ones lose their fear.

Their auras will shine brightly, unmistakable.
And their holy spirit will stand unbreakable.
