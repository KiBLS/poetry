The new lessons

In math, incidence values are calculated,
in biology they teach how the virus mutated.

In German lessons they write corona texts.
And that conspiracy theories have bad effects.

How to put on the mask in the right way?
And how do one follow the rules every day?

How can you deploy a covid rapid test?
And what crazy virus protection is best?

Only useless garbage is taught in schools.
And critical thinkers are treated like fools.

Teach your child the truth without inhibition!
Teaching the true situation is a sacred mission.

But teach your child also to be reserved!
For otherwise it will be public observed.

We live in wild times, nothing is certain!
It'll still take until the fall of the curtain.

The fate has determined already your course.
So just continue on your way to the source.
