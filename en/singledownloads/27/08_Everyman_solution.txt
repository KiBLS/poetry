Everyman solution

How can all this crap possibly continue?
Can I choose options like from a menu?

Can I hand over again my responsibility?
And thereby continue my cushy servility?

Or will submissiveness break our neck?
While we all wait for our next check?

Everyone must become self-responsible!
Only this way the madness is stoppable.

It makes no sense to give anyone your vote!
Or to obey something that a man once wrote.

What do you want? How do you want to live?
Do you only want to take or also to give?

Do you want to give virtual numbers a value?
Or create from the old something entirely new?

He who controls himself, he shines bright!
And he then becomes aware of his own might.

Who knows what he's doing, needs no one to ask.
And he is also well aware of his sacred task.

Know thyself was always the true embassy!
To consolidate his own will and supremacy.

Free yourself from all the mental waste.
And it's your own freedom that you'll taste.
