Stand or fall?

Who swallows further the lies has elected.
By a diabolical collective he'll be collected.

For it is a real betrayal of all mankind,
if one keeps remain deaf, dumb and blind.

It is a real violation of one's own race.
If one does not seek a way out of the maze.

The d-evil has itself truly desirable dressed.
Start to look for answers and go on your quest.

Don't keep getting distracted by nonsense!
For knowledge and wisdom are the best defense.

One can read a lot of things during the day,
but bullshit leads you down a wrong way.

Always check your sources and question!
This leads in the end to true satisfaction.

Those who seek the eternal truth will find it.
For those that can stand must not submit.
