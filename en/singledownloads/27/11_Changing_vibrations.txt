Changing vibrations

It's not things that become more expensive.
It's money that loses value, very intensive.

Those who print the money create slavery.
And they officiates with deceptive bravery.

Any value is only a contrived illusion.
Like a mental and deceptive conclusion.

We are all being brought into a single line.
And we all believe that this would be fine.

Thereby everyone has different predilections.
Due propaganda we're facing wrong directions.

Always live the way you believe is right.
That is how you can ignite your inner light.

And when you start to shine, it will be seen.
That's how you decode the power of each gene.

So you put a real power plant into operation.
The true self then recognize its own vibration.
