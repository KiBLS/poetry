Set yourself free!

Buying material things that you don't need.
In order to satisfy the own artificial greed.

To impress people you don't actually care for.
And to fill your own emptiness more and more.

The Mammon is like an endless addiction.
To true satisfaction, a real contradiction.

You continually need something to fill the hole.
You need to constantly play your fictional role.

But those false propgrams will hang-up and crash.
And foreign injected dreams will end up as ash.

After that, you look for the next satisfaction.
But from what you need it is again a distraction.

Recognize this delusional cycle and escape!
Break out of that mental and physical rape.

Break your slavery chains and free your mind.
And thereby become a bright beacon for mankind.
