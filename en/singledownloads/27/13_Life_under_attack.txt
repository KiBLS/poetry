Life under attack

A new wireless body area network is injected.
Under the pretext that everyone is infected.

A hidden secret vaccination tracking system.
Is cutting you off from your very own wisdom.

A new body operating system will be installed.
The real mark of the beast it is also called.

Without it, you will be excluded everywhere.
Self-replicating nanoparticles, they scare.

Electromagnetic radiation sends the commands.
Biological zombies are migrating in all lands.

The electromagnetism works like an evil spell.
The victims build on earth their personal hell.

They can no longer think, completely paralyzed.
If people knew that, they would be surprised.

But ignorance protects no one from punishment.
Blind faith and obedience leads to astonishment.

The transhumanist system will not last long.
Because the programming is basically wrong.

Prepare for the greatest imaginable insanity.
For it is hacked just the whole humanity.
