Harmony

The moment right now is perfect,
and yet I often try to reflect.

In my body I live and dwell,
and here I want to feel well.

Where my body is, I live.
What I have I gladly give.

I try to spread illumination.
I wish that for every nation.

I don't long for a personal goal.
Right now I feel as a whole.

Future and past are illusion.
A kind of personal delusion.

The consciousness is the key.
To access the true eternity.

Realize your potential now!
The seed grows after you sow.
