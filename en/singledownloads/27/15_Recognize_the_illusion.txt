Recognize the illusion!

People play with dangerous ideas.
Mainly by securities and with fears.

Every fear is only an illusion,
mostly it's based on a confusion.

The same applies for security too.
Both are made from the same shoe.

This is a usual way to manipulate.
But one produces only deep hate.

You have to check your thoughts.
So as to untie your inner knots.

He who recognizes the web of lies,
he can see again with lucid eyes.

Through a deep, inner reflection,
You'll reject the tangled projection.
