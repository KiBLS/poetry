Freedom by blockchains?

That blocking is not good is not new.
And a chain is the thing that ties you.

If now, one combines these two words,
he cannot hope to become free as birds.

A blockchain should promise new liberty?
Whoever believes that drinks bitter tea.

Indispensable for transhumanist dreams.
But in truth, things are not as it seems.

Moving from one control tool to the next.
Solutions never lie in an advertising text.

Consciousness alone is creating a worth.
Thus new possibilities are given birth.

Become aware of the known possibilities.
And thus discard all mental disabilities.
