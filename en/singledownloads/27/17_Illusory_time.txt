Illusory time

The true and honest passed me by.
All seemed to be a blink of an eye.

So much time I have only wasted.
So much bad I had already tasted.

But from my personal point of view,
it was needed to realize what's true.

The eternal truth is inside everyone.
And it shines brighter than any sun.

It's invisible and yet unmissable.
And this light is never divisible.

Know the truth that is deep within you!
It helps you to create everything anew.
