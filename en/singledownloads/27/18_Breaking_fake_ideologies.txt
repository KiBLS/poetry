Breaking fake ideologies

We are like drops in a sea.
I'm in you and you're in me.

Truly I am very much like you.
Only with an expanded view.

Also, we are all interconnected.
Mutually we are all affected.

Separation is just an illusion.
Like a story without exclusion.

Everyone is part of the narrative.
To recognize it is an imperative.

Nothing was ever separated.
Everything you loved or hated.

You are part of "all that is".
Everything together is a bliss.

Everything that is, is part of you.
Heretical ideas are nothing new.
