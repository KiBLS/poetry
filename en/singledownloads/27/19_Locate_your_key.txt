Locate your key

Many do not understand what I say.
Because they're on the wrong way.

Many do not understand what I do.
Although what I do is nothing new.

Many do not understand what I desire.
For they didn't find their inner fire.

Everything was always in the same place.
Your own perception creates the space.

That way you'll wander through the ages.
That way you can leave all the cages.

Know who you are and unlock your power.
And it will begin the most exciting hour.
