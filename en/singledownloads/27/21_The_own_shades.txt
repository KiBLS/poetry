The own shades

Ignorant fight on the outside,
true warriors turn to the inside.

The brave achieve victory there,
and thus are victorious everywhere.

By facing one's very own delusions,
one will overcome all confusions.

Only those who create peace within.
Have risen above any material sin.

So start to face your own shadows,
for your salvation is already close.

And as light on the horizon rises.
You'll become one who just realizes.
