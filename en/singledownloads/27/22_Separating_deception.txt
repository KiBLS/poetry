Separating deception

What is eternal cannot pass away.
What is eternal will always stay.

That which is eternal that is you.
What seems old becomes again new.

You are a part of the big whole.
Know thyself is your real goal.

Nothing could ever separate you.
For you're a part of the one true.

Black and white arise in the mind.
By perception, everything is defined.
