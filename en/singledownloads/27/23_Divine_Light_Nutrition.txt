Divine Light Nutrition

144,000 feed on their inner light,
thus their auras shine very bright.

They do not fall victim to toxicity.
They live their lives in simplicity.

Nobody could twist their thoughts,
they constantly change their spots.

They're the true unteachable ones.
Of "all that is" they are the sons.

They know everything and yet nothing.
All temptations they're crushing.

They are what is left at the end.
They're the ones who never bend.
