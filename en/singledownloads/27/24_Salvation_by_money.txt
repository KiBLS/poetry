Salvation by money?

Where are the ones that don't bend?
Where are the ones that don't vend?

All knowledge and wisdom must be free.
Only then everyone will be able to see.

Those who trade and sell such things.
Have long since lost their holy wings.

They have still so very much to learn.
For it doesn't matter what they earn.

Mutually, we could all be benefited.
Financial delusions were not permitted.

Materialism was alwas only a deception.
For everything is ruled by the perception.
