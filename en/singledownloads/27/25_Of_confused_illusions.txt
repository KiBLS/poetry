Of confused illusions

With the word begins the illusion,
this already creates the confusion.

Always contradictions are co-created.
Including everthing loved and hated.

Illusions are only created in the mind.
And thus in the outside it is defined.

As there is contradiction to everything!
As to fly one needs not only one Wing.

Every contradiction is also born in you.
This realization is not something new.

This way, they have always dominated.
And the contradictions were then debated.

The answer to everything lies within you.
Even if until now, you had not a clue.

Now just become aware of your own power!
And we will ring in a new and holy hour.

The gods who once again become full aware.
Those who carry thoughts through the air.

These are the ones who change the earth.
And thus the new consciousness gives birth.
