The longed awakening

When the reality mixes with dreams.
Then nothing remains as it seems.

When the hidden becomes obvious,
then the loser becomes victorious.

When suddenly everything is changed,
then everything will be rearranged.

The temporal sensation will be shifted.
And a true seeker will then be gifted.

All the nonsense takes on a meaning.
Succeeded by your internal cleaning.

All the endless patience was worth it.
Because awakening - you deserve it.
