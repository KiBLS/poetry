Chemtrail filth

Nanoparticles appear like mysterious fog.
Many think that it is not even a smog.

I can see it in the morning sunshine,
It is covering the complete skyline.

But even right before my own eyes,
I see the particles as they flies.

I have to breathe in this nasty dirt.
Knowing that it is meant to hurt.

Every living creature must endure.
Officially against it exists no cure.

Chlorine dioxide is the best aid.
MMS/CDS can be easily be home made.

It provides your cells with oxygen.
And it is a very powerful oxidant.

Propolis is also a very beneficial.
And tea tree oil also helps initial.

Fine Zeolite is also a great remedy,
keep all these substances in memory.

Organic sulfur is needed everywhere.
It's important knowledge that I share.

It'll be a help to you in these times.
Substances are well hidden in rhymes.

May they help you with any disease.
Thus, many things will be an ease.
