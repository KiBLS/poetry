Once the light shines

When the darkness finally disappears,
the clouded, gloomy view just clears.

When the new morning finally shines,
one can see previously darkened signs.

Things become clear in the transition,
Simultaneously sprouts a new cognition.

The shadows are becoming ever clearer,
And the change comes always nearer.

And suddenly you begin to realize,
That all fears are fading at sunrise.
