Hypocritical Opposition

I'll start with resistance now.
I will manage this somehow.

I will now collect many donations.
And advertise at demonstrations.

My own merch I am going to sell.
And even other things as well.

I will pay taxes and be straight.
And engage myself in every debate.

I will earn money that others print.
And thus make a resistance sprint.

I rant and grumble about the state,
and say its about the rules I hate.

The more money I will generate,
the less I've to follow the dictate.

This is how I offer true resistance.
And never question the existence.

After all, resistance must be legal.
Like coins minted with an eagle.

I do not see any contradiction here.
Because Mammon is singing in my ear.
