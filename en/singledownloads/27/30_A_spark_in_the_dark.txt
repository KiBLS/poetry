A spark in the dark

When chaos seems beyond control,
one suddenly realizes the true goal.

In the hours of greatest threat,
awakens in many - a new mindset.

Only in the darkness some realize,
that light shines before their eyes.

Nothing could stop them anymore.
They know what they're fighting for.

Answers that were previously hidden,
appear to one as if clearly written.

Necessity will then force action,
and it disappears any distraction.

The day when those heroes are born,
is the day to sound the sacred horn.
