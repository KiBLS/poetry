Time difference

My energy is steadily decreasing.
Yet vitality is what I'm chasing.

Things are getting more complicated.
Over time, I feel like I'm outdated.

The demands are increasing ever more.
And nothing feels the same as before.

Maybe it's my decay that I witness?
As I lose my own youth and fitness?

Meanwhile outer time passes very fast.
Not keeping pace makes you an outcast.

Yet my inner time determines my being.
But only outer time everyone is seeing.

But the outside world is not the true!
From the inside world it has no clue.

What counts is only the inner clock.
For there the outside world must knock.
