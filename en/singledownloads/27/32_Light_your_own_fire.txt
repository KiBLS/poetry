Light your own fire

Be yourself a light inside the dark.
Even if you are only a small spark.

Let unrestrained your inner light shine.
And transform polluted water into wine.

A spark can ignite a sacred flame.
That's how you change the dirty game.

Live the way you want the world to be!
This is how you will become fully free.

Whoever understands the rules can win.
And thus elevate himself above any sin.

Only those who disdain money and power.
They will herald the system's last hour.
