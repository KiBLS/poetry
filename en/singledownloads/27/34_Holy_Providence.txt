Holy Providence

People are fighting for their survival.
And recognize the brother as a rival.

The delusion sits deep in the mind.
From all the lies, they became blind.

Money has poisoned their sacred souls.
They operate now under alien controls.

Blinded by the deceptive beastly picture.
Runs before all eyes the holy scripture.

Chance or providence were always the same.
Part of all that is. Kindle a sacred flame.

The future and the past are soon revealed.
All becomes visible on the sacred field.

The chosen ones will soon be in place.
To shine brightly with their full grace.

Then the theater play will be completed.
And the evil will finally be defeated.
