It reveals slowly

The history and the reality merge.
And it begins the final purge.

Nobody could ever sugarcoat it.
The majority will just submit.

Carbon - 6 protons and 6 neutrons.
In the atomic shell are 6 electrons.

Graphenes of carbon are fullerenes.
It slowly changes everyone's genes.

Out of the unholy mark of the beast,
These spike proteins are released.

Through the well-known G7 Meeting.
The first beast sends its greeting.

Afterwards, all appears crystal clear.
What has always viewed by the seer.

Prophecies will soon be fulfilled.
And the one kingdom will be built.
