Prophetic words

I can see the end of these sins,
and how the new chapter begins.

This system will soon go down.
Rulers handing over their crown.

Delusional ideas drive up the wall.
A new generation takes the ball.

Everything has to happen like this.
So that you can receive your bliss.

The storybook is drawing to a close.
It's a new beginning where it goes.

From the old, the new will arise.
And finally, humanity will be wise.
