From end to new beginning

A real zombie pandemic is brewing.
No matter what you are doing.

Discontent reaches new heights.
Darkness tries to obscure lights.

Radiation will fuel the madness.
And poisons will foster badness.

Insanity will rage for a short time.
And there will be terrible crimes.

But all must happen in this way.
So that we can begin a new play.

Secrets are finally being revealed.
Evil loses every protective shield.

So our cocoon shell finally breaks,
regardless of how long it takes.

The new butterfly will then hatch.
And it will begin its new life match.
