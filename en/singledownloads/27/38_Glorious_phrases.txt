Glorious phrases

Powerful words in a powerless place.
Brave words in a world without grace.

Real recognition they will not find.
For the majority is long since blind.

Deaf to the holy truth and deluded,
their whole mind became polluted.

The wheat separates from the chaff.
About the truth they just laugh.

Currently criminals wear the crowns.
And saints are portrayed as clowns.

All the poles were simply rotated.
And the true is everywhere hated.

But the top will be on top again.
When the evil will end its reign.

That day of change is drawing closer.
He's paving its way like a bulldozer.
