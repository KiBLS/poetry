Just Illusion

When everything is an illusion,
why is there so much confusion?

And why I can not control it?
When after all, I surely know it.

What provides the constant flow?
And what helps it all to grow?

Countless dimensions side by side.
But to visit them there is no guide.

Awareness alone creates perception.
It helps to see through the deception.

He who frees his mind faces insanity.
And grasps the sense of humanity.

All is in one place at the same time.
Like deep wisdom hidden in a rhyme.

It is not recognizable to everyone.
Unless the change in you was done.
