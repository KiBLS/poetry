Now grow and thrive!

Living in the middle of a lie.
Thus just opening the third eye.

Whoever opens his eyes knows,
how in the dark his light glows.

The realization grows and thrives.
And becomes sharper than all knives.

His tongue becomes like a gun.
Out of him shines the inner sun.

The light that no one knows anymore.
It opens with ease a brand new door.

Only he who becomes wise will know.
How to keeps running the whole show.

He is growing at an unimaginable rate.
Thus, consciousness reaches a new state.
