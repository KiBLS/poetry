End of the age of lies

Dumbing down tactics that hit the wall.
Lies that prepare for their own fall.

Truth does not shine on any screen.
But deep within you it can be seen.

Just explore the real and the true!
And it will expand your narrowed view.

This change is truly comprehensive.
It's everything but not expensive.

You are a part of everything that is.
It is revealed what before was a quiz.

All the effort is really worth it!
For you are the one who deserves it.
