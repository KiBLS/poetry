History in flux

Courageous voices fall silent.
They are fought with violence.

Injustice becomes now right.
And black becomes now white.

Insanity becomes the new norm.
It is the calm before the storm.

Everything is twisted and perverted.
Believers are being newly converted.

Unholy times are now prevailing.
Through wicked times we're sailing.

But all that happens has its meaning.
It is part of the great cleaning.

Nothing here will be spared.
A holy war has been declared.

And at the end of this wild story,
something new is told full of glory.
