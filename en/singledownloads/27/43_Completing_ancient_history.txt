Completing ancient history

Be sure; there is no turning back!
So stop coloring things so Black.

Always nurture and promote the good.
Be a spark in the midst of firewood.

When everything around you breaks,
just be one of those who awakes.

After the old story, a new one begins.
It's the fall and crowning of new kings.

Reason and ancient wisdom are rising.
And slowly everyone is realizing.

That which has long been proclaimed,
is that at which everything aimed.
