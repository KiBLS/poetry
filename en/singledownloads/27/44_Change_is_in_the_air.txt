Change is in the air

A sweeping change is taking place.
A holy transformation full of grace.

The buildings of lies will collapse.
People will close all knowledge gaps.

About the old lies everyone is amazed.
Voices of resistance are being raised.

Voices that have a long time rested.
Everything so far was only tested.

But when a supposed hoax turns serious.
Even the majority becomes curious.

No censorship can stop the brain waves.
Nothing can prevent awakening of slaves.

When new and good things become manifest,
suddenly everyone helps and does his best.

The common goal in front of our eyes.
Will expose any barefaced, brazen lies.
