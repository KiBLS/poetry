Biased studies

All the studies are just eyewash.
And yet many people think, gosh.

Nerve agents are hidden in food.
And affect the results and mood.

Environmental toxins in the drinks.
For all toxins - only missing links.

Even the air is highly polluted.
All this is in the body undiluted.

Those interactions are not observed,
thus a distorted result is served.

Nevertheless, one finds a result.
Thus, science remains a faith cult.
