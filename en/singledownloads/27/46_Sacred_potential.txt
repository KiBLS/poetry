Sacred potential

My cage of thought was just unlocked.
It was freed what was earlier blocked.

My consciousness is rapidly growing.
And I understand my inner knowing.

No poison in the world could stop this.
For I have received a very divine kiss.

The new generation of holy prophets.
Operating without intention of profits.

Everything that is - it makes sense.
It overcomes any artificial defense.

What could stop this sacred awakening?
It's the coronation of a new Sun King.
