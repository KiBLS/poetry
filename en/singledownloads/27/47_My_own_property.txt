My own property?

How could anyone call a land his own?
And declare it as "his private zone"?

Only those who believe in "a state",
will not participate in such a debate.

A state construct is only an illusion.
And brings many heads the confusion.

Those who supports the state think,
They'd own land by a paper with ink.

Those who print the money are winning.
Without considering that they're sinning.

The good always only lose in the process.
And have to gain money through stress.

Land areas can not belong to anyone!
For when all is sold, stops the fun.

When in Monopoly all streets are sold.
And worthless numbers replaced all gold.

From then on, everyone should realize,
that in this system he won't win a prize.

One must begin to question everything.
Even whether he needs an outer king.

And the game must then be completed.
For otherwise sorrow will be repeated.

This is how the journey leads inside.
Where you can discover all your pride.

Everything you need you will manifest.
And what happened so far was only a test.
