An infinite moment

Just a moment ahead of the revolution.
And yet still so far from the solution.

The fronts can no longer be overlooked.
A diabolical recipe that is being cooked.

Admonishing voices are simply ignored.
And in the media, those liars are adored.

The madness is just driven on and on.
Reason and sanity has long since gone.

A new, even nastier system awaits us.
And many believe that even God hates us.

Like pain of a childbirth, isn't evil or bad,
we must realize that our path is not mad.

While the caterpillar becomes a butterfly,
at no point does the caterpillar ever die.

We all need to take a comprehensive view.
For only that way we will discover the new.

And as we mentally leave the old behind.
The new world is already being designed.
