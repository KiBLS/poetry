Biased words

Today, the word God is totally messed up.
Like a doll that is beautifully dressed up.

The Church has personified that which is.
And burned those who knew as witches.

A sentient being? Full of love and hate?
And this crazy guy is directing the fate?

Like a psyhopath to whom you should bow down.
To whom you must cheerfully put on a crown?

As if God had an independent personality,
that could react with hatred and brutality.

All that is has no will and no opinion!
And it cannot behave like a little minion.

It has no body at all, for it is all that is.
Realize the oneness and enjoy the bliss.

You are an inseparable part of the whole! 
Discern your divinity from head to the sole!

The division and control will come to an end!
And thus, we will collectively make the ascent.
