Change without judgment

People get used to so very much.
And yet they should never judge.

For things always look otherwise.
If one looks at it with other eyes.

Consider the variety of viewpoints.
And realize all the invisible joints.

Because everything is interconnected.
And thus everything is mutually affected.

If you want to make a real difference,
just eradicate your very own ignorance.

Recognize the interconnectedness of all things,
and in this way let yourself grow holy wings.
