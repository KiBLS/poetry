Singularity

When a weakness becomes a strength,
you overtake others at full length.

When your flaw becomes a feature,
the student then becomes a teacher.

When all your fears just go away,
only pure self-confidence will stay.

Let your holy transformation be done.
Without a fight, saints have always won.

They give themselves to what is eternal.
And thus they awake their inner kernel.

Do not try to force it with your will.
Just sit down and start to chill.

True power lies in one's own tranquility.
This is how you train your mental agility.

Everything is one and you are all that is.
You yourself are the solution to the quiz.
