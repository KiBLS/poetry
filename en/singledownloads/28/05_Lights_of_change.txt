Lights of change

Chaos is taken to the highest extreme.
In this play, it will be the last scene.

Madness will reach the highest heights,
there will be incredibly merciless fights.

But when the darkness is omnipresent,
even slaves will master their ascent.

For you recognize in the deepest darkness,
every spark of light in all its sharpness.

Many will meet their well-deserved end.
But many will perceive a new era's scent.

They will raise their voices for the good.
For they are aware of where we stood.

This is how the poles will then turn again.
And goodness will take up its holy reign.
