Write your story!

What do you eat, and what do you drink?
What software do you use? And what ink?

Don't support anything that harms others.
Know everyone around you as your brothers.

Promote only what is good and genuine!
Recognize in your neighbor the divine.

Everyone is part of the great whole.
Everyone here plays his personal role.

Like a wonderfully lived fairy tale,
from which suddenly is lifted the veil.

You are the main character of your story!
Realize this and play it now in full glory.

You are the scribbler and the performer,
for your world, you are the transformer.
