Understanding the past is an important key.
It used to be said: "Work sets you free!"

From Concentration Camps to Quarantine Camps,
and in the streets armed troops and armored tanks.

And now it doesn't take a genius for one to see:
Soon they'll say: "Vaccination sets you free!"

Dissenters become dangerous thought criminals.
This all suddenly happens like small miracles.

People consume and long for their own fears,
even if this causes a lot of unnecessary tears.

The real change is fueled by this insanity.
So that we recognize again our humanity.

A transformation at a tremendous cost.
But in the end, we will have won, not lost.

Together we are heading for the golden age.
And thereby we are all leaving our cage.

We have never known true freedom before.
But now we are going to push open that door.
