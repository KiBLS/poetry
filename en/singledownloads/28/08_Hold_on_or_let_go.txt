Hold on or let go?

By giving up something old,
something new can unfold.

By finally letting go,
something new can grow.

He who lets go, gains new. 
And can recognize the true.

Anything flows in one stream.
Reality becomes like a dream.

The dream is under your control!
Thereby know thyself is the goal!
