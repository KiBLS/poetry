Awakening to ascend

What if I take over the control?
Realizing that I'm part of the whole?

Could I change my behavior?
And thereby be my own savior?

Could I change my own mind?
And thus stop remaining blind?

I want to make the impossible a reality.
I want to make a use of my given key!

I want to recognize everything that is.
I want to give it a consecrated kiss.

My path shall be the way of ascent.
Thus, I want to forge a new sacred fundament.
