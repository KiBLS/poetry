Set the impetus

Really letting go is the hardest thing.
Even for the consciousness of a king.

Without any doubt about the why.
I allow the familiar to pass me by.

The world is in this moment simply as it is.
Neither a cursed hell nor a heavenly bliss.

My own perception influences my point of view.
If my perception changes, anything becomes new.

What do I really want, what do I truly desire?
Do I extinguish my spark or turn it into a fire?

Are you perhaps afraid of your own flame?
Remember it is a part of this sacred game!

Be fearless, this will start a global conflagration!
This raises a fundamental and needed vibration.

The dominoes will just fall over in a row.
And the world will return to its natural flow.
