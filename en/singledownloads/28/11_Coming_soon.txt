Coming soon

Pick up your pass for worldly amusement.
It's also for your freedom of movement.

It comes a digital vaccination certificate.
For obedient subjects absolutely legitimate.

He who lets his genetics be manipulated wins,
and may continue to indulge in worldly sins.

Those who refuse to submit are sent to camps.
And they will have to compete for food stamps.

Truly, there are still hard times ahead.
For some time yet, the evil will lead.

The evil regime will rule for a few years,
and in that time will flow bitter tears.

But all falsehood will eventually self-destruct.
For the truth tears down every false construct.

When a holy light shines into the dark,
it will just ignite heaps of new sparks.

Sacred sparks that meet with dry hay.
And thus show us all the new way.
