Fracture of the times

Time is an imagination in your head.
Just like viruses that you spread.

Hours, days, years and even decades,
cast clearly discernible shades.

Who recognize the lie can break out.
He conquered his ignorance and doubt.

He'll open hidden doors out of nowhere.
About other opinions he does not care.

He rises unexpectedly from the hidden.
For an awakened one, nothing is forbidden.

Since he timelessly sees through everything,
he elevates himself to the new Sun King.
