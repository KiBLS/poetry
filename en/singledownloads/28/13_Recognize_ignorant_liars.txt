Recognize ignorant liars

Chlorine dioxide cures almost everything.
It is literally a healing miracle king.

When you can cure the flu in a few hours,
then what do "viruses" have for powers?

Or were simple toxins cheeky renamed?
That something invisible can be blamed?

Is the entire science based on lies?
A big pharma fraud of unimagined size?

They play exclusively with the fears.
And feast on all the appearing tears.

It already starts when you feel queasy.
Whereas healing yourself is so easy.

But asking a panel doctor about health,
is like asking a banker for wealth.

Instead, listen only to your own inner voice,
for it is the wisest and most prudent choice.
