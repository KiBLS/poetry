Become what you want to be!

Do not talk yourself bad or down!
Rather put yourself on a crown!

If you don't like the way you are,
change it and become a real star.

Your perception creates your reality!
For your happiness only you hold the key!

Miracles blossom every day and everywhere.
About this you only have to become aware.

If you really want to change, change your perception!
This will push you in a completely fresh direction.

And after a very short time you will see.
That alone this has changed your whole reality.
