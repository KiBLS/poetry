Modern everyday poisons

Doctors prescribe rat poison, without inhibitions.
But it's only one weapon of their poison munitions.

Because once their poisons have taken effect.
Mustard gas will possibly be their next project.

Even from dynamite as a drug they do not shy away.
And prescribe it in small doses as angina spray.

Only the dose makes the poison, it is often heard.
But the dose rises with every intake, totally absurd.

They hit the body with poisons like savages.
And in doing so, they cause entirely new damages.

Even the air, the water and the food that you eat.
Everything are poisonous mixtures by a evil recipe.

Propolis, zeolite, CDS and DMSO are simply ignored.
The newest and toxic drugs even win an award.

You must learn to act on your own responsibility!
And thus regain again your own credibility.

Just explore new paths and recover in the process.
Thus, at the end of the path, there will be success.
