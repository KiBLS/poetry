Increase your vision!

Just feel happy and satisfied right now!
And do not ponder long about the how.

There is no need to be sad or depressed,
in this moment you can feel truly blessed.

The future and past is only in your head!
Regardless of what others have said.

Recognize this eternal running moment.
And realize that of it you are a component.

From everything what is nothing can separate you!
Look at everything with an all-encompassing view!

And when that which is eternal is recognized,
reveals that which was previously disguised.
