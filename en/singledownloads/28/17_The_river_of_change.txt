The river of change

Are you feeling low-spirited? Depressed?
Did you forget what beats in your chest?

Well, just let me build you back up!
Because it is now the time to get up.

Just let go of your old thought crap!
Because we are not doing another lap.

Forget your old concerns and loads!
Because we will take entirely new roads!

Do you realize now what times are ahead?
Do you realize what energies just spread?

A true river of pure energies that pours out.
And seeds that germinate and soon sprout.

Jump into that stream and let yourself drift.
Together we will experience the greatest shift.

This change is as unique as you are!
Realize your dreams and become a star.
