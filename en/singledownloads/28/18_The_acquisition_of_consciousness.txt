The acquisition of consciousness

What's the value of illumination these days?
Who still wants to wander on those old ways?

The majority strives only for money and power,
they don't realize the current ringing hour.

Illusions for which one sacrifices everything.
For the delusion to become thereby a king.

Today no lie or deception is bold enough.
And one no longer sense his own handcuff.

Today people call it a "blocking chain".
And no one sees that it only causes pain.

All poles were completely perverted and twisted.
So one may think the good has never existed.

Everyone just continues to follow blinded,
his lower desires - completely absent-minded.

But the day of change is getting nearer and nearer.
And the masses begin to see it clearer and clearer.

Nevertheless, it will be a shock for the majority.
When the influence disappears, from any authority.

But we are heading straight into a new age.
And we all have to leave our thought cage.
