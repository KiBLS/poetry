To my inner sun

Without you, my life went up and down.
Without you, I had not recieve a crown.

Without you, I was one of many seekers.
Without you, I listened to a lot of speakers.

Only with you everything makes more sense.
Only with you my life became more intense.

I thank you for your sacred presentation.
It was just an unforgettable sensation.

That brief moment when I discovered you.
Has suddenly created everything in me anew.
