Deliberate change

He who cancels his own role,
is well aware of the whole.

He who sees through the play,
is fully aware of his own way.

If we all see through the game,
we will leave behind every name.

Days and weeks will lose their worth.
And infinity experiences a new birth.

The day we become fully deliberate.
We'll head for times that are great.
