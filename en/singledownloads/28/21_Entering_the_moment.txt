Entering the moment

I don't have to become anything, I already am!
I don't have to do anything, and yet I can.

The outside and the inside harmonize right now.
The consciousness has all the necessary know-how.

Enjoy this moment! It is all that will ever be.
And only this present moment you will always see.

An ageless and eternal moment that lasts forever.
Unfortunately, most people question this - never.

However, those who recognize this wisdom and truth.
They've already rediscovered their inner youth.

They are becoming more aware of connections.
And thus run automatically all inner corrections.

They come back into the flow with that which is.
And thereby give themselves a redemptive kiss.
