Final revelations

Dissenters are looking at hard times.
All warnings are concealed in rhymes.

A dark thunderstorm is soon coming.
And all the clouds start drumming.

For the truth you'll be persecuted.
Therefore, many are even executed.

But the truth can never be defeated.
For mental lies will soon be deleted.

What was once small will become tall.
What once rose high will soon fall.

The polarities are reversed once more.
Understanding will flow from every pore.

Everything that was once well concealed,
will be exposed so that all can be healed.
