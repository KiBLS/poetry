To new heights

Your innermost shall begin to glow.
Thus sadness and despair shall go!

Find confidence in the times ahead.
Be a living one among the living dead.

After the chaos, all will blossom anew,
and the holy sky turns back to blue.

The change will soon get underway.
The old will go and the new will stay.

This change is truly the holiest event.
For it is your very personal ascent.
