My legacy

If someone asks what I leave behind,
it's my own poetry - personally signed.

If anyone asks what I have done,
I used my thoughts like a sacred gun.

No one can say that I have agreed.
For I am one who overcame his greed.

No seduction has been great enough.
I am one who has remained tough.

And I will become even much tougher.
For I am illuminated and not a bluffer.

In days gone by, people like me were saints.
For our thoughts were free, without constraints.

But in modern times, we're antisocial and needy.
No matter what we do, to others we appear greedy.

Outcasts who don't help to promote insanity.
Old-fashioned madmen who believe in humanity.

Those who recognize and understand connections.
And who are aware of the necessary corrections.

That which is necessary for healing will take place.
And so, one by one, we will emerge from this maze.
