Vibrations

Good music beats makes you vibrate.
It truly can make you feel great.

Sometimes you need the stillness.
And sometimes colorful shrillness.

In constant variation up and down.
At times serious, at times a clown.

Don't ever get easily pigeonholed!
Free potential has a worth like gold.

Live like a beggar, feel like a king.
Possess nothing and yet everything.

Thoughts create wealth and poverty.
And they contain every other property.

Through the mind, the world gets a form.
But silence makes you ready for any storm.
