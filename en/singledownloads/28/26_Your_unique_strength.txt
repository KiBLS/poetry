Your unique strength

Gaining freedom through submission?
Always asking someone for permission?

The one you ask for authorization,
acts contrary to a sacred creation.

Nobody could ever give you orders!
For you shall be free from borders.

Your thoughts should constantly grow.
Because only exempted they can flow.

He who frees himself will understand,
that his whole being is an own brand.

Like an acting role in a theater play.
You can obey orders or walk your way.

Others will find it difficult to cope.
Yet ancient insights create a new scope.

A playground exactly as it was meant to be.
Where everyone can rediscover his own beauty.

Remember you are and always have been unique.
And suddenly it'll be strong what was once weak.
