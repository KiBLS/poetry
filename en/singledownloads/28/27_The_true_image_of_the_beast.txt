And again I start with a little Bible quote even I am not a supporter of any religion.

>>> Start of the quote (Revelation 13:15-17):

"And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."

>>> End of the quote

The true image of the beast

Right now you are staring at the image of the beast.
The image was spread carelessly from west to east.

You can wear it in a small form in your right hand.
At least the small version is available in every land.

The big version you have right in front of your head.
Every interface user is a member of the living dead.

Speaking images effortlessly beguile the masses.
The image of the beast is worshipped in all classes.

It lets you hear whatever you desire to be heard.
It subjugates you more and more, with every word.

Enchanting numbers that will captivate you.
This conjuring game is truly nothing new.

How could the old prophets have named it otherwise?
They could only see it through their third eyes.

Leave the false god, just leave everything old behind.
And suddenly you will see, where before you were blind.
