The sunny times

I see a lot of weird interpretations on the Internet.
And I keep hearing that we Germans have so much debt.

I got taught that we were the really bad guys.
And now our people have got to pay the price.

But when I look around me who was the winner.
I can only believe that we were not the sinner.

Today, lies are told and nobody keeps his word.
They only wait till we again raise the sword.

Da evil will not give in or retreat.
They look at us only as useless meat.

When the good are silent, evil will speak.
And it imagines that the goods are weak.

But armed with the truth, one cannot lose.
Even if the enemy controls all the news.

Every management position is infiltrated.
But for this change we have long waited.

This time we know who is on which side!
In such holy times we'll truly turn the tide.

The light of the sun shines much too strong this time!
In this time we'll expose now every wicked crime.

In the end, the evil has nothing left to amuse!
Because it is eternal freedom what we choose!
