Out of darkness into the light

Politicians need police protection.
For they insist on a fantasy infection.

Scientists who support these lies.
And media that portray them as wise.

One thinks all have lost their sanity.
It is the biggest fraud on humanity.

Everything is orchestrated worldwide,
and there is no room left to hide.

The madness rises to a whole new level.
There's no mistaking the pact with the devil.

All thoughts were twisted and seduced.
As a result, so much pain has been produced.

But in the deepest darkness, it will shine.
In the greatest sorrow, water becomes wine.

An alphilosophical reaction takes place.
For what has to come, it forms the base.

And what is coming will be magnificent!
Because the great awakening is imminent!
