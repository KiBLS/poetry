My final separation?

I'll give away all my useless things.
And then I'll finally spread my wings.

I'll only have the bare essentials with me.
And I'll leave without a house or flat key.

It will be a departure with no return.
Cause there is so much I wanna learn.

I want to finally feel true liberty.
I'll free myself from all negativity.

I simply give up everything that is useless.
I simply give up everything that is truthless.

Others will call me a homeless bum.
And many will do so, not just some.

Yet nobody can understand the path I take.
Maybe it'll be recognised when I fully awake!
