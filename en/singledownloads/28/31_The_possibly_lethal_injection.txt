The possibly lethal injection

I'll raise my voice for the powerless!
Before all the life becomes flowerless.

Children and the elderly are the first victims.
Even if none of them show any serious symptoms.

First they will attack the most vulnerable.
Because they are sadly the most attackable.

My resistance echoes in holy rhymes.
My verses are protected through all times.

I write lines and verses that are sacred.
Even if some people think that's hatred.

The coming times will become really hard!
All my lines shall act as an inner guard.

In the future everything will be understood!
On that day we will have beaten the falsehood.
