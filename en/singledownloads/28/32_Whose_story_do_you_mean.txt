Whose story do you mean?

History is always the idoctrinated view of the teller.
Unconsciously he acts like a propaganda seller.

Every single person's point of view is different.
So everyone has of the whole a partial element.

Every person has his own unique history.
And this is often decorated with a lot of glory.

Where the one won, the other one lost.
But these are only two stories that crossed.

There also still many observers of the event.
And everything is different what they present.

History is a nice distraction and entertainment.
But only the here and now is the whole content.
