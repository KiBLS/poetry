Rise to what you are!

Bow down or get off your knee!
Do you want to work or to be free?

Do you want to be a consuming slave?
And slowly dig your financial grave?

Learn to live on your own accord!
And elevate yourself to a lord.

Let the outside world talk its dull crap.
They are caught in their own mousetrap.

The day you realize your own uniqueness,
it will cause to disappear any weakness.

You then discovered your own strength.
And you will beat everyone by lengths.

At this stage, there'll be no more fighting.
Only then will life become really exciting.
