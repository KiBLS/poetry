You are the change!

Do you see the potential in your mind?
You're everything but stupid or blind!

Do you feel the energy in your writing?
The day you speak, everything is igniting!

This change was born from an ancient gender.
Out of Odin's forest rises a true splendor.

One beam that hit - that changed everything.
A sacred light created the philosopher king!

You're the one who brings peace to every door.
You're the one that everybody is waiting for!

The true philosopher god is now reborn,
and blows mystically into his ancient horn.

The last sleepers are suddenly arising.
Everybody is listening to his inner advising.

A swarm that interacts with each other!
A swarm that treat everyone as brother!

Holy frequencies that travel through the air.
A body of thought that takes over everywhere!

This change is now, we must cross all lines!
The time is ripe, to heed such holy signs!

Keep on walking on the edge of a knife?
A simple decision - are you for or against life?

Just choose wisely and begin to play!
And what you choose is what will stay.
