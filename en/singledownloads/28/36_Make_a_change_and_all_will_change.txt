Make a change and all will change

Where people speak and listen freely,
inspiration flows in streams, really!

Where free spirits exchange thoughts,
light shines brightly even on dark spots.

Where carefree minds exchange thoughts,
the lights shine with a myriad of watts.

Be someone who inspires people around you!
And in turn invigorated minds will surround you.

According to the principle of like attracts like.
Thus your most important hour will strike.

These are not prophecies but logical flows.
And everyone aware and sighted just knows.

That which is eternal will be revealed.
And all the madness will be healed.
