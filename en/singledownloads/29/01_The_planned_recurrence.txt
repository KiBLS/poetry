The planned recurrence

Again, a military build-up is taking place.
For peace, however, it was a futile chase.

Again, ready to slaughter for the authority.
Regardless of the opinion of the majority.

Killing in the name of the great reset.
With the outcome of innumerable dead.

There would be so many reasonable souls.
But the money-rulers pursue other goals.

Someone sensible wouldn't want to rule others.
Rather, he would treat them as equal brothers.

But madness rules through money and fear.
Although the solution is so close and clear.

Self-responsibility, self-reliant, independent.
These are characteristics that shine resplendent.

Adhere only to what seems genuine to you.
Thus you can create miracles out of the blue.

This is how we will change the world together.
And in this way we'll continue to thrive forever.
