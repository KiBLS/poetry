The repetitive new old

All the old things are breaking down,
while new things are not yet tangible.
The current rulers lose their crown.
Thus something new can grow and is expandable.

Mystical and mysterious in the past.
Not understandable to the masses.
But these times have now passed.
For light falls in spite of sun glasses.

It dazzles people, because it is so bright.
For a long time it was extremely darkened.
But now it shines again the most divine light.
And thus, that which is, has been hardened.

No religion is stronger than the truth.
No lie is more powerful than the true.
It draws its circles first among the youth.
Everything begins with a renewed view.

And therefore we bury the old.
To give birth to something new.
As we fulfill what has been foretold.
Everything begins right now in you.
