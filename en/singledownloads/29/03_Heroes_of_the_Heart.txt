Heroes of the Heart

When finally the chaff separates from the wheat,
it'll show which hearts still have a real beat.

The process drags true fighters into the spotlight.
They're aware that they've to face a hard fight.

However, they are self-confident and full of trust.
By sheer force of mind, they shake off their dust.

Their hearts blaze with fire. For everyone unmissable.
For them, the reality bends. And they're indivisible.

Their minds vibrate in harmony with their hearts.
This enables them to master all the supreme arts.

As they stand up to the world, with their heads held high,
They are the new born heroes, who will never die!
