Dystopian hellscape

Devils in suits live very pleasant.
But it does not reflect the present.

A handful controls all the riches.
And treat the rest like little bitches.

On the one hand is extreme poverty.
In the other hand, all the property.

On the one side, nothing is given to you.
On the other side, you get everything new.

A hypocritical society we are living in.
It's our energy that we've to bring in.

But the turning point is imminent.
Beatified will be all the innocent.

And just as the poles are once more turning.
In most people the holy fire starts burning.

This is how the change is finally achieved.
Thus, a new reality can already be perceived.
