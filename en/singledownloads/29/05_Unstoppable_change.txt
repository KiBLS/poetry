Unstoppable change

Never before have morons been so well recognised.
They're the ones who have their faces disguised.

Utterly subservient slaves and naive imbeciles.
They serve only corrupt and unscrupulous criminals.

What a madness that takes place in front of my eyes.
The vast majority serve and propagate ineffable lies.

How can the whole of humanity be so incredibly dumb?
And how can these lies be seen through - only by some?

All the people take their lethal injection voluntarily.
Just so that they feel safer and better temporarily.

What does it take for humanity to finally awaken?
How much more do people actually need to be shaken?

I hereby leave my message for later generations.
That they may build a society on different foundations.

Don't let yourselves be poisoned and betrayed by each other.
Instead, treat the one closest to you as a beloved brother.

Together make sure that old crimes are not repeated.
This will be the day when falsehood has been defeated.

It's sad that I probably won't have the chance to see it.
But that day will inevitably come, I guarantee it.
