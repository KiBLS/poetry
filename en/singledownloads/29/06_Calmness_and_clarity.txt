Calmness and clarity

Meditation creates new neural connections,
and simultaneously run inner corrections.

Therefore, in tranquility lies the power.
He who discovers this heralds a new hour.

The own perception is formed thereby anew.
So that one can recognize again the true.

In stillness all thoughts can find a way,
towards solutions that are here to stay.

A calm mind brings fresh clarity and peace,
and the wisdom to realize what doesnâ€™t cease.

For the power of meditation is strong and true,
It can help you to find your way through.
