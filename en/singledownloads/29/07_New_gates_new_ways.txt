New gates, new ways

When one door closes behind you for good.
One often becomes aware of where one stood.

Recognizing the end of a path is like an art.
Thus, one might recognize the new start.

But if one door closes, many new ones appear.
Enter a new one with trust and without fear.

And it doesn't matter which door you choose.
Trust that it'll be the right, so you can't lose.

New doors are always full of new possibilities.
For your new path you've already all utilities.

And thus the old is superseded by the new.
That in the end you can recognise the true.
