Manipulative language

Every word is a manipulation you send out.
Whether it is confident or full of doubt.

With the word the contradiction is created!
And these contradictions are then debated.

With every word, there is further division.
This does not require a conscious decision.

Language can heal but it can also destroy.
It can cause suffering but also a lot of joy.

Consider what you are using your words for.
And don't sell your creativity like a whore.

Use all your words wisely and intelligently.
This is how your language becomes elegantly.
