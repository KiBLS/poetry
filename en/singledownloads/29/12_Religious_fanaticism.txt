Religious fanaticism

A god who demands sacrifices shall be fine?
Words and deeds will form the hidden signs.

Ignorance and oblivion is the true blasphemy.
Like a denial of the true allphilosophy!

People have been deceived and very misguided.
For they have been constantly further divided.

They mentally cling to old and phony scriptures.
And are afraid of foreign thought pictures.

Always listening only to external preachers?
Those who pretend to be sanctified teachers?

Sense or contradictions are not recognized.
By blind faith, everything alien is demonized.

How could such blind faith ever be healed?
If it's ignored everything that is revealed?

That which is still hidden becomes apparent.
And the building of lies becomes transparent.

It's your task to discern the signs of the times.
Currently they are still hidden in sacred rhymes.
