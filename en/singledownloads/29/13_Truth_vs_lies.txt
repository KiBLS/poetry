Truth vs. lies

We live in truly insane and corrupt times.
One can observe at every corner crimes.

The promoted stupidity shows its effects,
one doesn't even pay attention to all aspects.

Simulated viruses generated on computers,
and regime changes by help of sharpshooters.

Wars are instigated with emotional lies.
And from TV you only get brainless advice.

It is impossible to believe all the insanity.
It seems like the darkest time of humanity.

But the change of consciousness is taking place.
Both polarities are involved in a daredevil race.

Who wins is completely clear in the end.
Because many will master their own ascent.

And just as one monkey learns from the next,
it becomes obvious that the true is not complex.
