Unpleasant

Having contact with people you don't enjoy.
Surround yourself with them? For what reason?
To serve them as a preferred gossip toy?
For yourself, it's like a poisonous treason.

An illusion of attachment hampers you.
Useless traditions must be finally broken.
To let the old glamour resplendent anew.
Until the day the truth was spoken.

The words will find each other and flow.
The mind must first attune itself to the new.
That is the way you will ultimately grow.
Destiny happens no matter what you do.

The old will despise you as it passes away.
It is impossible to please everyone.
Yet by doing so, you'll show others the way.
Rise against injustice in the name of the sun.

That which is old will soon disappear.
And what is even older will awaken again.
Proceed on your way without fear.
And your journey will not be in vain.
