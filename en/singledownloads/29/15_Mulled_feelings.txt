Mulled feelings

There is no reason to feel bad.
Destiny evolves to make you glad.

Trust that call and its direction.
It merely opens up a new section.

When a chapter is coming to a close,
it raises an inner tension for new shows.

What happens must happen in this way.
Just as a night will be followed by a day.

Just be calm and have confidence,
thus you will take your own dominance.
