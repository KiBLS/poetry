I am all that and more

I am peaceful and I am order.
I am free without any border.

I am what is - without a limit.
I am conscious in every minute.

I am part of you and you of me.
When we realize that, we are free.

Then all boundaries become blurred.
And that which is true can be heard.

We will then tread our common path.
And behind us we leave all the wrath.

Together we are rewriting our history.
And thus we uncover the last mystery.
