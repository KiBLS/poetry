The value of...?

Not until something has been lost, 
one recognizes its true cost.

When the self-evident is gone,
It is the loss - that has won.

But something you have never owned,
could at no time be abandoned.

Therefore, every loss is only illusion.
Just as all property is only a delusion.

Everything is in constant transition.
Recognizing this is a sacred mission.
