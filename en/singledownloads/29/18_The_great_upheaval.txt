The great upheaval

The caterpillar passes away,
and the butterfly will stay.

The egg will eventually break,
and a young chick will awake.

The old will simply disappear.
And the new is already near.

A true splendor will just arise.
The old makes room for a new size.

Transition happens without incident.
The awakening, however, is imminent.
