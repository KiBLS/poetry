Be special

A sighted man among the blind,
one who speaks among the deaf.
Among all the crazy ones, one is kind.
Among the dead, one still has breath.

He speaks the truth and no one hears.
He lives the true and no one sees.
And in such a way there pass the years.
He could solve the mosaic with ease.

No one wants to know the answers,
everyone thinks he's a hypocrite.
He'd be just one of those dream dancers.
Of wisdom no one wants to benefit.

Everyone just wants the quick buck.
Everyone thinks only of themselves.
The general public, they give a fuck.
They seek truth in contentless bookshelves.

They are wasting their precious life time,
with meaningless content they fill their brains.
The majority doesn't recognize a sacred rhyme.
And toxic nanotech flows through their veins.

Their suffering is completely redefined.
Redemption becomes out of reach for the majority.
For the true and redeeming they are blind.
Therefore, they submit to the most brazen authority.

But many still recognize the light in the darkness.
They are the ones who create everything anew.
They recognize the shadows in all their sharpness.
In all adverse circumstances, they stand for the true.
