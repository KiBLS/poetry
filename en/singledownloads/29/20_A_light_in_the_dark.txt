A light in the dark

I go to places where I am most needed.
I go to places where no one has yet seeded.

No matter how gloomy a cave appears.
I'll enter deep into it with loud cheers.

I will plant seeds of confidence and delight.
For I carry within me the greatest might.

And even under the most gloomy condition,
I'll follow my heart to fulfill my mission.

And in the darkest darkness my seeds sprouts.
Exactly where before there were only doubts.

Because the inner light begins to blaze.
To lead me out of this endless maze.

I always go on, intuitively in one direction.
And thereby running all the inner corrections.

An inner change that is taking place.
To put an end to my futile chase.
