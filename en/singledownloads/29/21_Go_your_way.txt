Go your way!

You will discover what was believed hidden.
You will cross the line that was forbidden.

You will bring about the longed-for change.
Even you will find it completely strange.

Every wise and knowing one will support you!
Everywhere you go you will meet the true.

Real warriors will rise up in your name.
To finally put an end to that evil game.

Your path will lead to where you need to go.
When it is needed, your innermost will glow.

Continue on your way without hesitation.
And unleash in you the greatest sensation.
