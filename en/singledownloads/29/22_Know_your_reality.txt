Know your reality

You are the reason behind the thought.
You represent something cold and hot.

You are not just a drop in the ocean.
You're the totality of water in motion.

The paradise is where you are walking.
And truth is where your voice is talking.

Reality is creating itself around you.
Wherever you go, it creates something new.

Unimaginable it remains only for a while.
Once it is imaginable, it grows a smile.

Then you will see through what is real.
And what you label as sick will heal.

Everything does not have to make sense yet.
But reality and you harmonize like a duet.
