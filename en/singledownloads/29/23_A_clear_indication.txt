A clear indication

As long as your mind is constantly engaged,
your consciousness will remain just caged.

Mentally active around the clock without rest,
to be present in idleness is your holy quest.

Your search could find its end here and now.
This is something that only you can allow.

Grant your own mind to rest and just to wait.
Thus you will pass through the longed-for gate.

You have already experienced where the exit is.
It is connected to what your objective is.
