Go to the next level!

Trapped between colorful, weird pictures.
Despite many trend-setting scriptures.

With the exit right in front of your nose.
Only you alone determine where it goes.

Once you realize your own responsibility,
you will unleash every needed capacity.

The little spark ignites into a large flame,
and it begins a new level in your game.

You are free to determine your own score,
for that's how you push open your new door.
