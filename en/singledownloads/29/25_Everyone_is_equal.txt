Everyone is equal?

Although every human being is unique,
conforming sameness is what many seek.

Everyone should submit to the same rules.
In fact, all geniuses as well as the fools.

But how can a small shoe fit for everyone?
If it is too small, it will hurt to run.

And how can one develop under paternalism?
It's absurd, like illusory freedom in fascism.

Everyone is unique with his personal view, 
that's why everyone needs his individual shoe.

Anything that doesn't fit you, you have to quit.
So just take off those shoes that don't fit.
