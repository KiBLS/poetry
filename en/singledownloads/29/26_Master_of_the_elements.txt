Master of the elements

My body is just connected with everything.
It's ancient, sacred knowledge that I bring.

I am part of everything in existence.
I rise above any illusionary distance.

I can not only set the winds in motion.
I can create hurricanes on the ocean.

I can not only heat simple objects.
I can create flames like special effects.

I blur the boundaries of the conceivable.
Even if the majority finds it unbelievable.

The change of times is now in full swing.
Just listen to how the inner voice will sing.
