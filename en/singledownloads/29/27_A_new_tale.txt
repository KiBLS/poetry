A new tale

The old story is drawing to a close.
It is a new beginning where it goes.

That which perishes is built anew.
The old fades and it opens a new view.

Old things will blossom once again.
Fumes are disappearing in the rain.

Shackled thoughts were set free.
And drops just mingled in the sea.

The twisted poles have been corrected.
And the whole world was thereby affected.

Where one story ended, a new one began.
It simply became part in the history of Man.
