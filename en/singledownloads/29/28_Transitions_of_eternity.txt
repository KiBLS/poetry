Transitions of eternity

Some came to leave, others to stay.
Some came to find their own way.

Some came to see, some came to do.
Some came to bring something new.

So many have come and gone already.
But only this eternal moment is steady.

It appears in a form of eternal transition.
And yet stays always in the same position.

Our awareness alone can perceive it.
Some do not suspect it and some believe it.

Many know, and even more are aware.
It is wisdom that exudes an unique flair.
