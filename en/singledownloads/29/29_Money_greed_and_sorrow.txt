Money, greed and sorrow

One lives comfortably at someone else's expense.
Without restraints, one takes even the last cents.

That's how one shows one's mendacious success.
And denies his subordinates the same monetary access.

The whole society is mendacious and fornicating.
And for the oppression they expect a good rating.

How hypocritical can you get with this delusion?
One's own prosperity and success - pure illusion!

For enough imagined values and illusionary power,
they would even sacrifice their last remaining hour.

An unimaginable pitiful downfall is what I can see.
Oh, how all this lying and hypocrisy disgusts me.

The change will cost bitter tears and despair.
What waits on the horizon is a hellish affair.

But the vultures have to go through this pain.
Because if not, all their suffering was in vain.

Just like a little child gets burned by a flame.
In retrospect, one becomes aware of the game.
