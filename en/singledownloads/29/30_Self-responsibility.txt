Self-responsibility

I act always emotionlessly,
but never unscrupulously.

I control all of my dealings.
And all of my inner feelings.

For others this seems strange.
But that is part of change.

Tell me why should I feel bad, 
if I can decide if I am sad?

Why should I feel charity?
I prefer to think with clarity!

But that does not imply,
that I wouldn't help another guy!

When I am needed I try to assist.
And thereby I act like a recidivist.

No one has to tell me what is right or wrong.
Because I am independent and also strong.
