Know your uniqueness in totality

Some lie so much that the beams bend,
and others dance to set to it an end.

As if any of the rulers would care.
Or recognise his error and play fair.

As if pigs beg the butcher for mercy.
They think there's a little controversy.

Unaware that their end is truly near.
They hold up protest placards and cheer.

Others are gearing up for the next war.
While the toxins ooze out of every pore.

One can no longer believe the insanity.
It seems that it has infected the hole humanity.

Everyone is looking for someone to listen to.
Without realizing that no one has a clue.

But if someone wants this madness to escape,
he must first apply his very own handbrake.

For as long as one is still externally controlled,
one is also still for sale in exchange for gold.

Only those who act on their own responsibility,
will stop their own richly decorated servility.

These are the incorruptible ones, holy masters!
These are the true and saintly forecasters.
