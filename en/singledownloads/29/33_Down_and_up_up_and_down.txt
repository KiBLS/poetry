Down and up, up and down

An inescapable path,
is paved with wrath.

Many fights will rage.
It will break the cage.

That darkness reigns.
But light breaks chains.

A sudden hope appears.
Its price: bitter tears.

Both sides in a delusion.
In the face of confusion.

The utter peak is reached.
When the truth is preached.

Silence falls on the drums.
Thus redemption comes.

From the ashes rises,
miracles in all sizes.

The new age begins,
free from harmful sins.

Since we passed the door.
Life blossoms once more.
