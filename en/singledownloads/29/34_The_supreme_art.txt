The supreme art

True success is not about making millions,
or governing and commanding civilians.

True success is to be free of needs.
Free from mental urges and deeds.

The master of his own will and mind.
This is how true freedom is defined.

The end of all these material yearnings.
And the renunciation of all your earnings.

Just be satisfied without any wishes.
Be able to fish and yet spare the fishes.

Those who finish their quest during their lives,
will be granted access to the sacred archives.
